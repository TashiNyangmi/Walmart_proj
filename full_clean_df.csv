1,Wrangler Men's Relaxed Fit Jeans,12.0,4.5,5840.0,wrangler is the best my favorite jeans extremely satisfying you can t go wrong with wranglers same old wrangler jeans great jeans i guess you can say it s one of a kind incorrectly labeled length mis sized they re getting cheap and don t last anymore great jeans would buy again defective stitching jeans tear easily in the seat one pair of the total three pairs ripped wrangler jeans sized right not ideal but usable pants worth buying again great jeans welcome back wrangler tag discrepancy on otherwise good jeans beware,i like wrangler the pants is exactly for my body also is a good quality recommend to all these truly are my favorite jeans i prefer the relax fit because they are more comfortable and loose in just the right areas i have purchased these a year ago and have held up really well the price is a bargain when you compare them to other jean manufacturers i highly recommend purchasing these jeans its absolutely wonderful and value for money size is perfect for small parties below 10 a satisfying experience i am a sturdy woman with a sophisticated build women s pants are usually too small in the waist and too wide in the hip for the length i need i ve tried plus sizes regular and tallls but found that buying men s pants are the way to go for women that don t have the fashion designers conception of a woman s shape height 5 8 weight 200 lbs i m wearing a 38x32 in washed sand after reading other reviews i was concerned that these may not be the jeans my husband was used to buying at walmart we had to purchase them online because our local walmart didn t have his size when they arrived he tried them on and said they were exactly the same as the ones he was used to purchasing the color was correct the pockets were the normal depth he was quite pleased with them excellent condition and thickness and color better than jeans three times the price great selection of waist sizes as well for the odd numbers like my size 35 waist 34 length i love how non restrictive these jeans are and the extra mini pocket behind the leg pockets is excellent my work id badge fits in there perfectly no more worrying that the feeble alligator clip will fail while i m walking around and i have to comb the entire office to find it again nnote the jean material is thinner than your average jeans not putting this in the cons because it s only a nuisance in the winter have to wear some thermal leggings under it when it s freezing out i m certain in the summer this is going to be most appreciated n ncons nthey only come in one color i mean come on at least offer it in black as well but it d be excellent if there were plenty of options perhaps navy blue and stonewashed so it doesn t look like i m wearing the same pair of jeans all the time ordered two pair with a 29 inseam and received an 30 inseam labeled 29 i didn t try them on my mistake and didn t notice it until after i washed them when i called i was told once i washed them i owned them i purchased 2 pair of the exact same size one pair fits perfect but the 2nd is over 3 inches too long in the legs it shows the correct size on the outside but the label inside shows 40x32 not 38x29 they must be using a thinner denim in these as they are barely three months old and splitting at sewn seam areas in the crotch and rear pockets everyday use motorcycle riding working there is a defect in the stitching process that caused these jeans to tear at the upper left corner of the right rear pocket all 3 pairs i ordered have now torn in this location i ve purchased the same size relaxed fit wrangler jeans at the local walmart store for over 10 years this is the first time i tried mail ordering them through walmart the pairs i received were probably manufactured by a different supplier and are clearly defective i will be seeking a refund at the local walmart store within 3 months the jeans ripped beside the left back pocket i tried to fix it so my husband could continue to wear them he only wears his new jeans when he goes to the grocery or things like that then he wore them again the other pocket did the samething i purchased 2 other pairs at the same time only a different shade and they are fine i m not happy about the pair that ripped i ordered these jeans online because i cannot find that particular size in any store whether it s walmart kohl s target etc it would be very nice if the stores would carry off size products so that customers can try them on to make sure that the fit is proper prior to purchasing or ordering in this case i am just grateful that walmart does stock differing sizes online so that i don t have to alter them after purchase thank you good price this latest purchase of jeans arrived almost as promised this is a reorder for me as i am very hard on jeans and tear them up easily this batch seemed thinner then the others i ve received and there is a noticeable difference in waist size between the three pair i received i purchased a couple of pairs a couple of years ago the jeans fit well and have worn well they faded as all jeans do but still had a nice color ni bought 2 more pair because i like how they fit for me to many pants are short from waist to crotch these have a nice size zipper also my son is very particular about the fit of his jeans from the time he was about 8 9 years old we tried different brands he always preferred wranglers then came the timr he grew out of children s sizes we tried a lot more brands and styles these wrangler jeans are the only ones he ll wear i m so glad they come in a wide variety of sizes and a few different colors these jeans by wrangler are great they are the relaxed fit jeans they fit great and feel great my husband loves them they are his favorite jeans we purchased all the different colors in the same fit i highly recommend these jeans and will definitely buy more my son and i go through a lot of jeans some for work some for play the brand that we normally have purchased for many years appears to be disappearing due to the changing retail marketplace i recently purchased a pair of these for myself and have been very happy with them quality is excellent fit and finish great i hadn t had a pair of wranglers since my youth many years ago and up to recently did not even consider them i refuse to pay 50 to 100 dollars just for a pair of jeans and i don t like any stretch fabric i want 100 cotton and i don t want them pre distressed i will distress them myself through wear and work i think my son and i have found our new go to jeans that said this was a purchase of 5 pair and will be a christmas present for my son but don t tell him non top of that the delivery time from walmart was excellent and beat all expectations the wrangler jeans were exactly the color and quality i ve come to expect from wrangler however they were mismarked i ordered size 34 x 30 relaxed fit but when they arrived they had the 34 x 30 relaxed fit sticky tag on the leg but the inside cloth tag was 34 x 30 regular fit i assume the mistake was made by the manufacturer and not made by the packaging handling person the package did not include a return statement but i will try to contact someone to hopefully exchange the jeans for the correct size,men's clothing,0
2,Wrangler Big Men's Relaxed Fit Jean,15.0,4.3,3257.0,jeans that fit just right great jeans would buy again fantastic experience with online shopping slightly poor material construction but ok different cut now don t fit that sucks not the same relaxed fit jeans not too happy cheap material less inseam not rugged wranglers wrangler has screwed up their sizes do not buy these they fit like hip huggers nice fit for me need a great pair of jeans extremely happy with my first experience with this these jeans are made of sturdy black denim good looking pair of jeans great jeans but garbage relaxed fit isn t the same not the same as old relaxed fit just right,if you like big men s style wearing jeans these these will do you just right i would recommend getting one size bigger these jeans are very good and comfy when worn right with right size everyday use motorcycle riding working they arrived sooner than expected and the fit was just right the sizing and description were perfect not confusing or so brief that you weren t sure what they were talking about all in all it was great and i will be buying these again online for my husband great experience i like these jeans but they do have a tendency to fray along the cuffs i roll the cuffs one time and the seam splits at the same point that never used to happen when i bought levi s jeans i m so disapointed i bought these same jeans for many many years they always used to fit perfect for me not anymore total different cut i m just going to try finding another pair of jeans wranglers suck now to me they were true to fit for many years now there cut way too small darn these were always my go to jeans nfor some reason wrangler changed their style and they no longer fit like a relaxed fit nthey now fit like regular fit nhad to return and reorder a larger size and their still on the tighter side nvery disappointed other reviews say the same nlooks like i will have to find another brand too bad wrangler used to be my go to jean sat down in them on first day wearing them and back pocket tore completely along the side these jeans are no longer wrangler i ve been buying wrangler for years and the 5 jeans i ordered fit just like lee jeans which of course vf jeanswear owns also tighter crotch area the dinim feels different more flex less real denim their relaxed fit isn t relaxed at all do your research old wrangler denim lovers the wrangler 5 star from last year and these are worlds apart in quality i didn t want lee jeans i wanted hard rugged lose fitting relaxed fit wrangler one star only because i have to select at least 1 size is totally wrong i ve been wearing these jeans for the last 10 15 years and never had a problem wheather purchasing them online or in the store they have always fit true to size with plenty of room and comfortable i currently have 3 pair of size 48x30 that fit ok just a little snug in the waist so i ordered 2 pair of size 50x30 and couldn t even button them needless to say they ve been immediatly returned why in the world companies feel they have to change things that don t need changing is beyond me i have been wearing the relaxed fit wrangler jeans for a number of years and have always been satisfied to the point where i didn t even try them on before removing the tags but these fit like hip hugger jeans which are not comfortable at all and i wish i hadn t taken the tags off of or i would have returned them asap nnot sure if wrangler is having them made at a different factory or what but the fit is terrible i have a hard time finding clothing that fit right this was it the jeans were excellent value they appear to be heavy duty which will be nice for long wear and durability for rough use the color is exceptional it is recommended by the manufacturer that the jeans be laundered prior to wear which is due to the dye which may color items lighter in color n ni recommend them whole heartedly you will not be unhappy with your purchase a i was extremely impressed with my first purchase delivery the price was good lower than anywhere else and the delivery was fantastic i received my order in only 2 days right in front of my front door i will definitely be using this method from now on for groceries and everything else i need i highly recommend this deep dark black color perfect fit as sized they are relaxed so the leg are comfortably loose to maintain the beautiful color i recommend that you wash in cold water any garment will fade if it is routinely washed in hot water they appear to made good and the quality looks good also a christmas gift for one of my brothers so not sure about the fit but i m sure they will be fine this is the only jean he likes wrangler bought for my husband s birthday 46 waist but it was too small waist could not button i will probably have to purchase one of the comfort flex waist ones instead straight trash bought 3 pair the legs are super tight and waist is super loose 2 pair had the zipper break the first zipper broke in day 1 the second a week later would highly not recommend these are the only jeans i ve worn for 15 years but they don t fit the same now ordered twice recently thinking the first order was a bad batch but like others have experienced the fit is very different than it used to be even though the model number is the same this new version has a shorter rise pockets that are difficult to get your hand into probably related to how tight they feel across the hips now not sure what model brand to buy now but this is no longer my go to jean disappointed in that my old relaxed fit jeans fit perfect and these had no extra room in butt or waste now i know i could lose some weight but the old jeans fit better these are tight on legs and waste these are perfect for me i have purchased other brands of relaxed fit jeans and they were too baggy on the thighs and rear these fit just right and the material is heavy duty i will buy more,men's clothing,0

4,Wrangler Men's and Big Men's 5 Star Relaxed Fit Jean with Flex,15.0,4.6,1490.0,saved money and faster delivery that amazon very comfortable jeans great fit not too baggy not too skinny very durable pockets are ripped on everyone about eight months wrangler men s relaxed fit jeans tight in thigh lighter color in front not solid ripped within the first week poor quality mis manufactured on purpose stupid bad quality control wrangler jeans still the best not what i wanted not a fan solid replaced all my old jeans with these these are ok good fit practical and comfortable at a great price wrangler doesn t miss how they fit,fit well great price same jeans i was buying on amazon and a lot less money these are very comfortable jeans and they don t cost a lot the material is not heavy and stiff like most denim and it s easier for a fat old guy like me to move around as a trade off the material is not as durable as most jeans it snags and tears easily i am happy to accept that trade off however given the comfort and price my son is very hard on his jeans he s an athletic guy with thick muscular legs so he doesn t like to wear skinny jeans or anything slim fit these jeans are just right comfortable with room in the leg and seat for a guy with legs and a seat the flex provides him with an even better fit i got him these during the holidays last year and they re still holding up wrangler jeans are the best lighter weight and more comfortable than other brands bought 2 pair wear every week nov to june color has not faded no rips or tears seams and stitches still holding these are usually a great product four stars just because i m an odd size and not available 35 29 or 28 i settled for 35 30 other than that the jeans seem like they are very durable and won t rip out near the pockets like other brands i switched to these because regular brand no longer available little bit baggy in crotch and butt area but overall very comfortable comfy durable jeans i would recommend i ordered my husband s exact size what he wears for every other jean he doesn t have heavy legs but he complained that these were slightly too tight in the thigh also the photo doesn t clearly show that these are bleached somewhat lighter in the thigh area they re not a solid color my husband has been buying these for years he works construction and found that these lasted longest for the price until the last year that is of the last 3 pairs we have bought all of them have ripped at the back pocket seam and in the crotch near the zipper within a week one of the pairs ripped the first day of use i m sorely disappointed in theses wranglers and will not be purchasing them anymore with summer only wore three times loop is coming loose already 13 days after return window fall or winter the inferior quality would have shown early 2 belt loops that are supposed to be above the pockets in the back are above the pockets in the front ridiculous to have them there 2nd time i ve seen them this way nobody needs 4 belt loops in the front 2 on each side of the button zipper it appears somebody changed the design without thinking i will not order these again bye bye wrangler the front pockets are all tangled up full of blue lent and one had a hole in it in one of the rear pockets there was rough round stone of some sort legs were wrinkled must have come from the factory that way bad quality control this is the first time i have a problem with these jeans the only thing i didn t like is there are too many belt loops close to the zipper there are two belt loops close together on either side of the zipper there should be no need to have two belt loops on either side one should be sufficient other than that the jeans are exactly as advertised fit is good and look is good i was looking for the wrangler jean s with the black flexibility waist band nthese didn t have flexible waist band so i returned both pairs couldn t get the regular relaxed fit so bought these don t care for them lighter weight than the standard relaxed fit they won t last long and i won t buy them again so much for new and improved not great quality for the price the flex is nice when doing yard work or home repairs these are my new go to i liked them so much i tossed my random assortment of old pairs and reloaded with various colors of these we usually buy the relaxed fit but they were out of his size so we bought these they were ok but we like the others better nothing wrong with these they just dont fit like the others the first pair of jeans my husband has been able to keep up he needs a larger waist but the rest of his pants are normal size the flex fit helps him the jeans are sturdy and look nice bought for my son and hes hard to fit in jeans as he doesnt like them tight he likes practical where he can move and work in them these fit the bill and look nice as well its a win here love these jeans they hold up well working outdoors relaxed fit true to size 6ft 4 size 36x34 loose need a belt to hold up just how i like them allows movement i would buy again apparently some are made in us and some in mexico the ones from mexico fit differently which is a plus hope they continue to make them there they have a little more room in them,men's clothing,0

9,Lee Men’s Big & Tall Regular Fit Jeans,24.9,4.4,913.0,great jeans from 501s to lee jeans best conversion ever the perfect jeans using the perfect online source i will purchase more in the future great for casual wear or tough jobs fit is not consistent size error belt straps why do the waist sizes vary cut and sizing has changed baggy jeans disappointed lee regular fit straight leg jeans i hope i m not stuck buying these in the future not the same jean durable nice jeans but runs small on wider m body great jean s and price can t beat this deal happy wife my favorite jeans,i have bought lee jeans for several years the two pair that i purchased most recently had noticeably crooked seams i called customer service which emailed me a shipping label the replacement jeans arrived in about a week and they were perfect the company really stands behind its products which is a definite plus i unfortunately wasn t around during the time when all denim was a heavyweight fabric nowadays it seems like most denim retailers sell paper thin denim and i am not a fan so for a while i only work 501s until i actually decided to examine a pair of lee regular straights and if you re looking for a jean that is built tough with a heavyweight denim these are it i love that they tell you how many oz you re getting in each pair i love the lazy s back pocket details and just the overall construction of these jeans lee jeans fit me perfectly and i needed a few spare pair after going through about 20 pairs at the store looking for the right shade and size i through up my arms and just decided to go online straight from lee com these jeans came in perfect condition and the whole process was easy and quick thanks lee i have been wearing lee jeans for many years i was never able to find size 35 waist in the stores here so always had to go with 36 now i have found 35 on your website at lee com and they fit well however it would be nice to be able to get a 29 leg length which you do not make 35 29 i liked the material thickness and cool wearing in arizona they fit well and conform to the waist rear and legs great lee has a tough zipper and should last well a top quality jean for the money nthank you walmart for offering such a great jean for casual wear or tough jobs i don t know if this is a quality control issue or not but i believe the fit on these jeans are not consistent my size is 36x29 and i bought three lee jeans in different colors same size different fits one was perfect but the other two ended up feeling tight i kept the hoping they would loosen up a bit but it s something to consider before purchasing i purchased these jeans for my husband from the product id number on some old ones he had and loved they did not disappoint he loved the fit first time wearing them one of my loops that hold a belt in place was torn out they snagged on a doorknob couldn t believe it i had already washed them so i didn t try to return them as i teenager or young adult lee jeans lasted forever now fabric is too light i buy the same size 32 waist jeans every time but the last ones i bought i couldn t button i just bought 33 s just recently and they re way too loose what gives did someone change how long an inch is i ve been wearing this style of jeans for a couple years fit me pretty well on my last order i noticed that they have changed quite a bit the legs are wider and longer and baggier in the same sizei have been wearing i ve been buying the same jeans for ever the last 3 pair i purchased fit in the waist and length but the rear and the legs look like they were sized for much larger jeans describing them as baggy is an under statement i have found another brand that fit and i will not be buying these again lee s quality control is not what it used to be i would not recommend these to anyone who is average sized if you are on the larger size husky then maybe these are for you i ordered 3 pairs of the same style and same size jean extremely disappointed when each pair was cut differently in both length and leg width i had to take them to a local tailor to shorten inseam and taper the legs to get a uniform fit when you order the same size and style you would think they would all fit the same sadly that was not the case have no idea where you have outsourced the sewing of this product but they are lacking in quality control regarding size my husband has worn these jeans for years but like everything else in our lives the corporation has decided to change the fit these jeans are advertised as fitting at the waist but this is no longer true for those that have long waist these jeans no longer fit like the previous jeans fit very disappointed in the new fit and had to return them i have worn lee regular fit jeans for decades and had loved them but the latest ones i recently purchased disappoint me i ordered them on line and immediately noticed they were way too loose in the waste i returned them and ordered a few pairs in different sizes they re okay but stretch out a bit while wearing them i miss the previous way they were made without so much stretch since i received them i ve been searching everywhere for different brand of jeans that look similar but aren t stretchy like women s jeans also i like them in light blue and the only place i can find them in that color is on line i have multiple pairs of lee jeans regular fit that i have purchased in the past these lee jeans regular fit are no where near the same quality the fabric is much cheaper lighter weight cotton the length is way off the overall fit is not the same looks like lee sacrificed quality to increased profit margin shame i love these durable jean in fabric length not too bell bottoms but the only down fall they run a bit smaller on waistline you must get a larger size if your boy has wider hips larger buttock and bit taller these are not stretchable i really like this particular style in the wylie color and keep buying them they are softer than the other normal blue jeans i don t know why can t beat the price nor the quality wash the black ones in a separate wash by itself or you will have dark grey socks and underpants hubby

10,Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,49.98,4.4,16.0,don t be fooled by the low price great lightweight down jacket in a nice spring color warm light warm compact storage cost great jacket great price great everyday jacket terrible experience,this jacket has really impressed me it s so light like a plastic bag yet is amazingly warm i have already worn it in temperatures in the teens and i wasn t the least bit cold brushing the snow off the car in the early morning a real value at the price great lightweight fall jacket in a nice color for spring i purchased the avocado color before it sold out wanted to say that the jacket runs moderately large but it s probably the 14 pounds that i lost while following a modified keto diet and the jacket is true to size well constructed and a real bargain at the sale price that i paid this is a great light jacket that packs well provides immediate warmth it can be worn as an outer layer but it really excels under a shell jacket i generally use it winter hiking snowshoeing during the descent i like to swap out my sweaty base layer with a dry base layer then put on the cirruslite down jacket with or without a shell depending on the conditions i m 5 10 165 lbs 178cm 75kg the large is roomy in the body but i have long arms 4 ape index so i prefer a relaxed fit for layering under the jacket the arm length is perfect for active movement purchased this coat as a mid layer for boarding in breckinridge zero to negative degree weather it worked as expected also utilized it to comfortably walk around the town with a simple base layer easy to pack good fit nice and very warm n great service and shipping n thanks guys for the price the jacket was a pleasant surprise nfashionable yet very warm and comfortable nquickly ordered a second color i bought this jacket to replace a soft shell jacket the jacket is versatile and has the right amount of down insulation to keep me warm when temperatures are in the upper 20 s i returned the jacket because i felt it was a little light weight it s now a month later and i haven t gotten my money back i used the return label and took it to the post office feb 12 usps tracking shows it was picked up by fedex two days later i called eddie bauer today and they told me they d received it march 5 that s 3 weeks for the package to go from massachusetts to washington state i never got notification of anything the call center seems to be in india they can only look at tracking numbers and receipts on a computer screen the woman promised me my credit card refund was in process all in all it s a nice jacket but don t have to return anything to eddiebauer,men's clothing,0
11,"Hanes Men's and Big Men's Ecosmart Fleece Full Zip Hooded Jacket, up to Size 3XL",13.99,4.5,2567.0,yesss get it fs great perfect for spring and fall good price average texture hanes black xl sweatshirt good quality for the price warped zipper do not trust the photos satisfied with purchase recommend they re ok not much more will purchase again warm and comfortable regular old zippered sweatshirt o k for the price hanes hoodie burgundy hoodies,i wanted this to be like the oversized zip up from brandy melville and it s perfect i m a size s m and i got a size xl so it s oversized and it s perfect i definitely recommend getting this nand the inside is really soft and comfortable 3 these sweatshirts are awesome ordered 4 of them for family photos at the beach the royal blue color was beautiful great quality and excellent value very comfy but a lot of lint does come off i like it a lot i wish i got a large though but thats my fault super soft im 5 5 and 140lbs medium fit well and a bit baggy which is the look i was going for however i wanted a more baggy fit lol hope this helps these hoodies i bought one for me one for my husband and another for my adult son are just right for days when the mornings and evenings are cool and the days heat up while they are still new they look like they will launder nicely and the fabric is soft enough to wear over a teeshirt this hoodie is good for everyday use i bought it as a jacket to wear over other layers which is why i bought a men s size small and i am a woman s medium the fabric will clean easily but it s not very soft i m hoping it will soften with washing the zipper is great and the hood closes well the issue i have is with the sleeve cuffs they are tight and i m a small framed woman i can t imagine what it would feel like on a man i don t really like how they feel when i don t have a long sleeve shirt underneath otherwise it s good for the money good mid weight sweatshirt for the price solid stitching good fit large rounded hood fits over a ball cap no problem the only things i would change is the draw strings could be more substantial the width of the sleeves could be a little more roomy its ok if you have normal arms meaning no muscle whatsoever but it stretched so that s ok and the pockets could be a little deeper i can fit my phone in there sideways and the side of the pocket just barely comes to the top it won t fall out but just keep that in mind if you have a giant phone also the zipper is pretty solid in my honest opinion fotl makes a better sweatshirt for less money with none of the issues mentioned above i got this one size up in xl so i could wear layers underneath i m normally a large i m 5 8 220 pounds and the large would have fit but with minimal cloths underneath maybe a t shirt plus a thermal with xl i can wear a sweatshirt under this sweatshirt nice and warm in the cold i ordered a men s large even though i am a woman i prefer the roomy fit of a man s sweatshirt the sweatshirt is fine and good for the price the only thing i didn t like is that the cuffs are a bit tight for a man i feel that they would be quite tight i love the fabric feel and the color navy blue but unfortunately the zipper is terribly warped it looks like i m smuggling a python totally unwearable this item is not what is pictured on the site the zipper and grommets are silver not color matched as shown i m quite disappointed the sweatshirt is just ok otherwise medium weight and hasn t pilled or shrunk in the wash yet catch it on sale and it s acceptable if you don t care how it looks the fit and feel of the fabric is exactly what i hoped for these sweatshirts are at the printers right now to have logos added so they have not been washed i have previously purchased hanes sweat shirts and have not had a problem with shrinkage or rapid fading i anticipate the same with these i am 5 3 118 or pounds and the large fit very nice on me i am a medium in womans and got a large for this jacket it was the perfect oversized jacket i say size up 1 time if you want that oversized look or maybe two if u want it extra extra big really light weight for what we paid i wasn t expecting much but these are really light weight these will do for a slightly chilly night but not one with a breeze or colder than mid 50 s other than that these are fine they re soft but i have no idea how they ll hold up in the wash yet i wanted a oversized hoodie and i ordered a size small in men and it fit perfectly the way i wanted for reference im 5 3 and its good quality as well shipping is fast only took three days to get here its super comfortable and amazing if your the type of person to like baggy sweaters definitely worth my money my 13 year old loves to wear hooded sweaters with zippers so when i came across these i had to buy i brought two one black and the other blue he said they were warm and comfortable so i will be buying him some more your basic zip sweatshirt with kangaroo pockets and a hood now they say hoodie fits well bright colors for women lightweight warmth fits under a dungaree jacket now they say denim jacket much thinner material than anticipated won t do much good against the cold on it s own could be used under a jacket for layering also the material isn t very soft a bit scratchy exactly what you would expect from a hanes product the hoodie my growing teen needed at a price that makes it easy to replace with the next size when he needs it i m so glad you can manage to keep the dye lots so close from year to year we use this hoodie on the hbo series euphoria and it s a blessing that they are almost a 100 color match all the time thanks so much for not changing a good thing take care stay safe,men's clothing,0
12,Hanes SUPER VALUE 10 PACK White V Neck ComfortSoft T-Shirts,15.99,4.3,1006.0,a basic white t my favorite t shirt replacing old with new not satisfied not long enough shrink more when washed necks were incredibly stretched out giving hanes a bad reputation junk t shirts nice shirts price not so v bad told it like it is exactly what i expected white t shirt below par excellent value where s the length transitioning very comfortable at great price,hanes t shirts are comfortable and correctly sized but thin perfect for summer and working outside in the yard but these really are more like an undershirt and not entirely appropriate for wearing in public call me old fashioned but seeing a man s chest hair through his shirt is kind of gross i have purchased 2 hanes men s comfortsoft white crewneck t shirt super value 10 packs on july 11 2020 they were excellent items i like them a lot i like to shop walmart com for everyday low prices free shipping on orders 35 or pickup in store and get a pickup discount i love walmart com a lot very happy with this purchase the t shirts are 100 percent cotton lightweight comfortable breathable and the price was awesome i found this great deal and took advantage of it i received them in a orderly time frame and i love them the reason i m giving 3 stars i m being kind the shirt does not fit the way the picture looks it doesn t fit up under your arms it hangs down it says x large it s long and not wide x large when you wash them it in cold water they shrink up and loses its shape so they are exactly as pictured basic white men s undershirts however they are very thin cotton material and neckline summer in md so i m not complaining and they stain and shrink very easily that said if you need them for casual loose day shirts or a tie dye project or light undershirts they re perfect just give em a good stretch when they come out of the dryer they are soft but they really shrink in the length when washed and dried for an xl size they really weren t long enough before washing disappointed in product beware the necks of all of these shirts were stretched out beyond belief when i received them none were tight around the neck whatsoever the photo doesn t show the back of the neck where the spread of the fabric is most remarkable although the name of the tshirt are hanes tha quality is not the same as the hanes that i got from the store in the middle of last year they are thin and flimsy the only reason for me not returning them was because my husband says that they may be good for sleeping only bad quality for the name after first wash they shrunk up and i can no longer wear them i would not recommend them or purchase them again why are 2xl undershirts now considered big mens shirts with twice the price tag nthis is not an un common size there is a place in the store in fact every store not just walmart the 2xl size is always empty stores do not buy enough to keep up with the demand i dont know who sewed these misshapen shirts but they did an awful job the necks all had a hug lump in them at the top like they had sewed in electra material also the fold crease that runs down the middle of these shirts will never go away never iron wash wait a year it doesn t matter it will never go away the size is the standard size after wash i kind of regret that i bought a size smaller but they are still good to wear the t shirts are on the thin side good to wear in the summer days very skimpy sleeves kinda short short in the body my fault should not buy lesser brand got cheap but now the brand i bought for years jockey is tracking me and with deals what the heck nmy father always told me not go cheap on shoes and underwear nstay safe nole don born in 1943 its exactly what i expected so thats good thing i mean its a white t shirt my husband wears under his work button down as well as his dress button downs my husband has worn this brand of tshirts for many years this is the first time he has been unhappy with them they are uncomfortable rough fabric and are too thin excellent use and well made washed beautifully in cold water and not dried too much nworth the money would definitely buy these tee shirts again when needed shirts are plenty wide but really short once washed they shrink up pretty good i don t wear 3x but had to buy 3x in these hoping they would still fit after washing them after shrinking the width is now perfect but the length is really short making it hard to tuck in my 12 year old son is growing up fast he is in that stage where he is transitioning out of boy clothes into men clothing was not to sure about the size however to my surprise fits like a charm great look made my little man feel like he is a big boy these are exceptionally comfortable and for a great price they are thinner than others and the sleeves are a bit shorter than others while still having good room in the shoulders all of which i find improve the comfort the material feels good too i plan to buy more of these,men's clothing,0
13,Wrangler Men's Regular Fit Jeans,12.0,4.6,6570.0,great jeans my go to jeans for years the best value jeans the perfect fit comfortable i will never wear anything but wranglers tiktok makes you crazy true to size quality control issue jeans do not last true to size great jeans great jeans wrangler regular fit jean sizes run small poor quality great jean at a great price good wrangler jeans hoping the quality endures great blue jeans,i got these for my 84 year old father s birthday he basically told me his preference he has always gotten this brand and fit and knows what he likes there was a mix up on the size when i originally ordered may have been my fault so my father returned the package via mail he lives in an outlying area where there is no store i ordered carefully the second time but still got the wrong size sent somehow i spoke with customer service rep who was very understanding he ordered the correct size and because of the difficulty for my dad to get out and the second mix up he authorized a no return on the wrong pants dad got the new ones and loves them overall very pleased with the product and customer service i ve progressed from 36x32 to a 38x32 relaxed fit jeans in these wranglers but after losing 30lbs and getting more muscular with weight training i ve gone down to a 34x32 regular fit good news for me but also a testament to how great these jeans really are i love the color selection in the jeans black stone gray dark blue light blue but i particularly like the fit and appearance not to mention the price they are all the brand name jeans i need to wear and they look great at that highly recommended according to the size chart i need 31 33 but 32 34 fits nice as well made in mexico i simply like it having paid attention more lately to the cut of different manufactures of jeans i found there is a difference in the cloth both in the feel and lasting ability i found that of the different jeans out there the regular fit works best for me some jeans were too short in the crotch and that varies from person to person but regular fit worked best for me i am sometimes doing things that require me to get some dirt on my clothes and i like the way wrangler holds up over time i really like these jeans they really are comfortable to wear and you can t beat the price i wear a size 32 x 34 which is sometimes a difficult size to find i have a couple pairs that i bought a year ago and there is no wear on them at all i really recommend these to anyone who is looking for a comfortable value minded pair of jeans i live in my wrangler i have lost a considerable amount of weight the past year due to a health situation all my khakis and slacks are 2 to 3 too large therefore my trusty wranglers are my dress of necessity daily i wear them with tee shirts to sport coats depending on the occasion i currently have 4 pair that fit have about a dozen that are too large in storage looking forward to being able to afford getting 2 or 3 more pairs so i don t have to wash as frequently as i do now i love my wranglers i haven t bought levi s for years wranglers are far above levi s quality and comparatively a true price performer i can get 3 pair of wranglers for the price of one pair levi s i rest my case best jeans and they fit perfect the thighs were a little tight but i was able to stretch them out tiktok made me do it and i was more than happy with it these jeans were bought for a cowboy wedding they fit my son perfect they are true to size and fit comfortably on him the watch pocket is sewn on sideways making it too narrow and too deep for a watch or anything else these have gone from a 5 pocket to a 4 pocket with lint catcher 1 8 inch wider would work but the extra rivet makes the pocket mouth too tight and 1 4 to 1 2 inch lower fine pants if you don t use that pocket though these jeans do not last my husband has wore them for years for work as a heavy equipment operator and every year they get worse and worse with quality issues bought 8 pair in november 2019 had to replace 5 of them by march 2020 bought 5 more then and now 2 the crotch has split in them and random holes forming after less then 3 weeks of wear i worked for wrangler in va for many years and saw how on a bad day anything was passed on quality but this is clearly an issue within the material bought these jeans for my husband for a cowboy wedding they fit him perfect not too long not too short just the right fit in the picture he s on the end on left hand side excellent condition and thickness and color better than jeans three times the price great selection of waist sizes as well for the odd numbers like my size 35 waist 34 length these are wonderful jeans my son is big and tall needed new jeans for work i ordered these from walmart com at 1 00 in afternoon the next morning woke up and fed ex had delivered not even 24 hours later they are wonderful great fit no alterations needed loose and comfortable jeans are wonderful price in lower 20s i have worn wrangler jeans for years the mexico product was well made and fit well the new nicaragua product runs at least one size too small i m going to go up two sizes next time to be sure of a good fit i love the value but can t buy my usual size i always used to try on jeans before purchase but my size has not been in stock for months at my local store the material is stiff and not very comfortable and the size didn t fit my fat thighs despite the same size fitting me on the jeans brand i normally use it s one of those pants where i can barely put them on and i certainly can t raise my knee up all the way in them if you want a cheap jeans option definitely try a size above what you think you are have always bought this brand of jeans for my husband to wear while on the job never had issues until the most recent purchase in may where now 4 out of the 5 purchased have ripped in the crotch area apparently they don t make them like they use to as this has never happened before jeans should last more than 6 months regular fit jeans can be a shot in the dark they all fit different these wrangler regular fit jeans fit the way the should the legs have a consistent tightness from top to bottom so many regular fit jeans have bulky legs that resemble a loose fit style no potato bags here these jeans let you flaunt your hard work on tight calf s and buttocks without being too tight in the area that can ruin your day i pick up 4 pair ever black friday at 12 a piece can you get a single pair of levi s for 48 my wife likes the way they look fit and so do i pick up a pair and if you like them hit the store in black friday for a deal you just can t pass up i have never bought wrangler jeans before it s always been levis i wanted jeans not made in china plus i had heard that levis donates money to black lives matters organization which is a marxist organization if true that s bad so i thought i would buy a different brand wrangler jeans turned out to be just as good if not better at a good price these pants go through a life cycle of looking like dress pants to faded black jeans they cost about 18 and are very comfortable they have a long life and will virtually survive just about anything i hope wrangler won t ruin its brand by tring to make them cheaper and ultimately taking them off the market completely when they discover that they can t fool all of the people all of the time it was my first time wearing wrangler blue jeans and i wasn t sure they would be comfortable and meet my expectations these jeans fit very well from the beginning to the present they are very comfortable and durable to wear the wrangler jeans are great to sit around and relax in as well as doing hard work in the price was very pleasing plus they were shipped to my door in a reasonable amount of time i would recommend these wrangler jeans to anyone who likes to wear blue jeans way to go walmart on a job well done,men's clothing,0

price buy one then buy more most comfy pants ever most comfy ever comfortable sleek good quality comfortable and long enough yay comfort and style very comfy,what a great deal this is knit as opposed to sweat jersey material see close up photo of material best for slender frame since it will hang and not cling to the frame photo is a size small got both the deep chianti and heather grey color is as on the website these pants have a perfect fit for someone 5 11 ordered m size the texture is soft to skin and is streachable the best part about these are they are stretchable and comfy they also tend to absorb a lot of sweat they dry off quickly and do not retain any sort of odor i wash them once in 2 days ni have one of these in black color and might buy another once soon n nvery good for exercise also good for quick outdoor tasks like going to the grocery store ni wear these all day long in winter i bought these last year and i loved them so much that i m glad they re back this year so i m buying them before they sell out perfect for lounging running errands or a workout fitted so size accordingly i am a smaller size female and i ordered a medium just in case after i washed they got smaller but i have had no issues they are a little baggy on me but that is the style i was going for and the price was perfect you honestly do not need to order a size up i also wear these while working in a warehouse and they have not ripped or tore they also keep me very warm cooler weather is here and i needed something comfortable and decent to wear while teleworking since i don t work in pajamas i had concerns about the tapered legs because i hate elastic pants legs at this price i was willing to give it a try i purchased one in every color and i m so glad i did when i went back a week later to get another set only the smaller sizes were left wash in cold water and low heat i expect them to last bought these for my spouse on the weekends if we are are just running errands or chilling my spouse will always put on joggers my spouse reported these are very comfortable almost like not wearing anything these are very lightweight and not for winter use more for fall and spring great for anyone that is always hot and the sweatpant joggers are comfortable my only complaint is that when i washed it i noticed minor pilling on the pants those little balls that some clothes will get i am sure this is because of the cheap quality however it was minor and i have washed it inside out since and they have been fine i can t say enough about how nice these sweats are and at a crazy price below 10 00 unbelievable how comfortable and we ll designed they are i bought three different color opinions and they fit perfect they don t look like conventional sweat pants at all more like leisure wear and they feel and look great on i highly recommend getting them while you can at this great price glad i bought three pairs burgendy gray and drab olive green what a buy i bought the darker grey in a small and the green in a medium for my teenage son and husband these pants are so soft that i just had to try on my son s and for under 10 i buy the thicker aw joggers each year for my husband that are fleece lined but i saw these in store and couldn t walk away from the price n nthey are a thinner material but great quality they have a good amount of stretch and adjustable drawstrings i ve washed both pair twice now and there was minimal shrinkage and no wrinkles n nthese joggers are a slimmer fit my son is 5 4 125lbs and the small fits pretty well he has extra length in the legs but he could use more room in the waist husband is 6 160lbs and the medium is perfect length wise and in the waist definitely recommend these as loungewear or for working out these so called sweat pants are an amazing deal they fit great look great very unlike typical sweat pants and the price was unbelievable for such comfort and quality i bought three 3 pairs and am i glad i did the colors offered several cool colors were just what i wanted and the workmanship overall was done to last you can wear these as leisure wear and no one would be the wiser great deal i highly recommend these sweat slacks these pants soft and super comfy i bought for my boys and my boyfriend and they love them i havent washed them yet so i cannot comment on how they hold up after washing my husband wears these soft elastic waist joggers constantly he likes the relaxed fit which makes the pants with pockets stretchy and comfortable they are moisture wicking he doesnt get hot and sweaty during a workout this item is true to fit and quality for the price is excellent i price a similar items at a big men shop would have cost 40 50 try this item if you are looking for a great deal you will not be disappointed bought these for my son and wished i had bought more he wears them all the time until i make him put them in the wash i really can t believe the price because they are great quality and very comfortable they are nice enough to wear while doing errands awesome comfortable worth the 10 buck i am a female and bought them for myself after i bought my teenage son a couple of pair and he raved at how comfy they were man i wish the women s department plus size would get this in the women s sizes but i am working well this the men s one just pair them up with a cute top and voila awesome comfortable worth the 10 buck i am a female and bought them for myself after i bought my teenage son a couple of pair and he raved at how comfy they were man i wish the women s department plus size would get this in the women s sizes but i am working well this the men s one just pair them up with a cute top and voila for context i m a woman 5 8 about 175 lbs these pants fit perfectly size medium they are soft and have a rich color they are lightweight without being too thin or flimsy comfortable sleek looking athletic pants good quality for the price will probably get a few more i have bought my son several pairs of these mostly because he s got a 33 34 inseam and they fit the fabric is a bit thin and they don t wear as well as i would like and that s why i give a 4 rating he is hard on clothes though but i am happy to find him something he thinks is very comfortable and he doesn t look like he s expecting a flood walmart carries nothing but a few pairs of jeans in his size in fact he s only 6ft tall i don t think that s unusual but its not easy to find much for him there this is a good time to mention how short sighted forgive the pun walmart is for anyone 6ft or over price on these is great though and he loves them not only comfortable but stylish n nice fabric comfortable knit not as hot as sweat pants better for florida winters these knit jogger pants are very comfortable to wear while you go out for a run at any time of the day i like the fact that you can do any kind of exercise with these joggers and not be uncomfortable well at least for myself it was comfortable enough for wearing out and run some errands or whatever you guys need to do definitely would purchase more in the near future this review was collected as part of a

the perfect shirt great traditional working shirt verified buyer worth it not great shirts are mis represented in product description great tee shirt worth the extra money good fit sturdy material colorfast great product for the taller man good quality wierd sizing good quality and good fit winner for husband dickies brand tshirts good t shirt needs options,t shirts are a good weight and length wash up good no shrinkage noticed my husband really liked them excellent price and fast delivery service very impressed will buy another color i highly recommend them loved that we got 2 t shirts for the price of one very happy with the purchase best hardworking t shirt takes a beating and doesn t shrink much after many hot water washes nice long tail stays tucked beware of knockoffs on amazon if it doesn t have the authentic sewn on dickies label it s a knockoff that sucks i bought these for my husband in both white and black he loves them and wears them daily they seem to have a nice durability to them the weight of the shirt give it a nice durable feel without being too hot i bought this for me as a big comfy oversized shirt it was on sale and i got two of these sturdy cotton shirts that are soft and dyefast for a bargain i will definitely be buying more the best all around t shirt i can find nice fit and long super comfortable nice thick material that lasts forever and a pocket i bought about 10 of these over 5 years ago and wear them to work and around the house every day and most of them are still in great shape this is a heavier weight shirt that those i normally see on store shelves and that is what i m looking for a full thickness cotton shirt with pocket for my glasses ni usually buy xl size shirts but in this case a large was perfect so be aware of sizing differences nthis is a great work shirt have been buying these dickies shirts for the past 9 years quality has stayed the same over this time hardly no shrinkage after washing and drying them in a dryer i highly recommend them for work or play i like the color and quality of the pocket t shirts but am unhappy with the dickies tag on the exterior of the left sleeve i don t like advertising stores or brands items certainly not without recompense these are soft and good fabric but they are not made right for the size the arms are long and huge and not in proportion with the width and length if the rest of the shirt very odd sizing n nand then all but the sleeves shrunk after one wash and washing directions were followed in the description these shirts are supposedly 100 cotton as shipped they are only 90 cotton nthe 100 cotton shirts are smooth and soft feeling where as the mixed material fabric is harsh almost metallic feeling not happy about this at all i returned the hanes tee shirts and bought the dickies large tall tee shirt for my husband he is 6 3 and 190 lb with a 33 34 inch waist his length is in his torso so he needs a long tee shirt the hanes tee shirts were too thin and cheaply made the dickies tee shirt has substantial weight to the material the stitching is excellent and no doubt this tee shirt will last much much longer than the less expensive hanes making it more of a bargain for my husband i did notice minimal shrinkage but not enough to have to go up one size my husband is a flooring sub contractor and is very hard on his work clothing the dickies brand seems to hold up the longest under the wear and tear he puts on his work clothing i like the long body of the tee the color selection is great the cotton material is softer than the previous versions but it is a little pricier probably because it is made in a different country read and follow the care instructions the older versions developed holes in about three to four years haven t worn out a newer one yet but some of the newer ones have twisted a little after 6 or so washings nothing like the cheap brands hope to have these newer tees for at least six years before holes appear husband is not exceptionally tall 6 2 but long through the torso also tends to wear his shorts on hips and not at the waist he uses these t shirts for work he likes the length of the dickie s tall shirts as he doesn t have to worry about his tummy showing when he s moving about or raising his arms it is also excellent quality heavier weight than regular t shirts just wish it came in a light blue the shirts are exceptionally high quality and are soft and very comfortable with one exception i ordered large size my normal shirt size the shirts say large but they are almost 2 sizes too big i haven t washed them yet so im really hoping that they shrink a bit in the wash other than that great quality and they feel very durable it could be just a typo in the tags or something but i think next time ill order one size smaller to compensate if they dont shrink in the wash i m a machinist so loose clothes are kind of a no no for safety definately will purchase again i got a couple of these and have worn them for a few months i then got a lot more as replacement for my uniform shirts these shirts look good and fit well i have been wearing dickies shirts for a long time and have never been disappointed i bought these for my husband in both black and whitw he loves them and wears them daily they seem to have a nice durability to them the weight of the shirt give it a nice durable feel without being too hot the dickies brand speaks for itself but the best is the walmart prices excellent fit and true to size good length and weight would like to see a few brighter colors

31,"Champion Men’s Open Bottom Jersey Sweatpants, up to Size 4XL",20.98,4.2,806.0,nice jersey pants comfortable well made great fit choose champion great buy nice pants but have to be altered long but okay you won t sweat in these very thin material with a lousy drawstring someone didn t look at the size iordered nothing to write home about not very good sweat pants a god send great pants one pair ripped after just one day of wearing them so rich do not buy online good sweat very lightweight material long length,great price for champion pants the jersey fabric is not too light that you can see through it and not too heavy like normal sweatpants they washed up very nice i dried them partially on low setting and then hung them up to dry all the way great buy love them wanted something comfortable that fit like pants real pockets and didn t restrict the blood from your ankles to your feet they fit the bill sure they are great for workouts but i wear shorts bought these for lazy days great fit long and comfortable these are not sweatpants beware that shipping is slow women s sweatpants too short for me so i buy men s m am 5 9 165lbs ordered light gray color to try the fit liked them so well i ordered the dk gray blk and navy love the 2 front pockets and the fact there s no fly in front jackpot these are lightweight fit beautifully extremely comfortable and have deep pockets cell phone wont fall out a little longer than average length my only negative take away is because they are unreasonably long they are at least 4 longer than my other sweatpants that are size medium which means the cost of the pants went up 15 20 because i ll have to have them altered but i do love the material and that s why i m keeping them just as advertised like many of us ive gotten bigger around and need an xl size to be comfortable but that means they come in like 34 inseam so i trip on them im eventually ill find a needle and thread and shorten them clumsily but it would be nice to have options in length i am 5 10 so not far from typical also made from that plastic feeling material thats supposed to breathe but just feels sticky to me decent just be aware these are quite lightweight to be called sweat pants seem more like loungewear to me bought the same brand years ago and unfortunately there is no comparison in the weight of the fabric i was hoping against hope that these pants would be heavy and thick like the champion reverse weave life sweatpants unfortunately that is not the case the material is very thin and stiff almost like a cloth pants with a very poor drawstring personally i think the fruit of the loom sweatpants sold for half the price are clearly superior to these pants i guess will return them i m a large man and i ordered large and what i got was small i m disabled and don t have a way to go to the store so i order online it wwas going to cost me too much to send them back i found a person who could use them and gave them to him i m not a rich man and i have to watch how i spend my money nice jersey fabric but not cut like the shorts i bought this summering the same brand the pants are shorter in the crotch i had to hem them 3 inches for my husband he is 5foot 8inches tall plenty big enough but i ve since found others at half the price and i feel cheated n nbut that s ok i m going to use them as my outer layer on frigid days and they ll definitely do the job not very well made good pjs not good sweatpants size is right after one wash they look like bad not worth the money on less your looking for lounge pjs these pants have been the best my grandson is handicapped can not walk and is confined to a wheelchair he is heavy to lift and these pants are just about the greatest to handle while putting them on him keep them coming at this great price these pants are comfortable wash well and are just as described on line i have had champion fleece pants for many years that just will not wear out these are lighter for summer and i buy men s small for myself because it is hard to find such practical pants for women one pair ripped between the leg area just after one day of wearing them just a few days after receiving the order they are comfortable and great for being around the house and outside as well they do fit a little big so i recommend ordering your normal size or possible one size lower these are so cushy and thick great material and waist band color maroon is so rich my husband is going to live these and want more these were defective very tight around ankle could not even get his foot thru about 5 inchest to long had to cut and hem good sweatpants material light weight while still being sweats bought xl and am 5ft8in and weigh 220 pants are about 3in too long but i can fix that for the good fit at the waist i bought these for my dad and have to return them because they are definitely summer weight and he needs them for the upcoming winter also the length was 5 longer than his other similar pants but they looked to be well made,men's clothing,0

41,Lee Men's Relaxed Fit Jeans,24.9,4.4,1049.0,great jeans from 501s to lee jeans best conversion ever the perfect jeans using the perfect online source i will purchase more in the future classic jeans great value fit is not consistent size error belt straps why do the waist sizes vary cut and sizing has changed belt loops paper thin and customer service baggy jeans disappointed lee regular fit straight leg jeans i hope i m not stuck buying these in the future not the same jean best jeans on the market love lee jeans great jean s and price lee has been my brand for blue jeans for over 50 years,i have bought lee jeans for several years the two pair that i purchased most recently had noticeably crooked seams i called customer service which emailed me a shipping label the replacement jeans arrived in about a week and they were perfect the company really stands behind its products which is a definite plus i unfortunately wasn t around during the time when all denim was a heavyweight fabric nowadays it seems like most denim retailers sell paper thin denim and i am not a fan so for a while i only work 501s until i actually decided to examine a pair of lee regular straights and if you re looking for a jean that is built tough with a heavyweight denim these are it i love that they tell you how many oz you re getting in each pair i love the lazy s back pocket details and just the overall construction of these jeans lee jeans fit me perfectly and i needed a few spare pair after going through about 20 pairs at the store looking for the right shade and size i through up my arms and just decided to go online straight from lee com these jeans came in perfect condition and the whole process was easy and quick thanks lee i have been wearing lee jeans for many years i was never able to find size 35 waist in the stores here so always had to go with 36 now i have found 35 on your website at lee com and they fit well however it would be nice to be able to get a 29 leg length which you do not make 35 29 the website makes shopping so convenient with these jeans lee brand you know what type getting and don t have to go to the store to get them great pants for work or play i don t know if this is a quality control issue or not but i believe the fit on these jeans are not consistent my size is 36x29 and i bought three lee jeans in different colors same size different fits one was perfect but the other two ended up feeling tight i kept the hoping they would loosen up a bit but it s something to consider before purchasing i purchased these jeans for my husband from the product id number on some old ones he had and loved they did not disappoint he loved the fit first time wearing them one of my loops that hold a belt in place was torn out they snagged on a doorknob couldn t believe it i had already washed them so i didn t try to return them as i teenager or young adult lee jeans lasted forever now fabric is too light i buy the same size 32 waist jeans every time but the last ones i bought i couldn t button i just bought 33 s just recently and they re way too loose what gives did someone change how long an inch is i ve been wearing this style of jeans for a couple years fit me pretty well on my last order i noticed that they have changed quite a bit the legs are wider and longer and baggier in the same sizei have been wearing within days belt loops come apart pants rip very very easily and there customer service after about 3 months fails to follow through after being a lifetime customer i will not buy this product again i ve been buying the same jeans for ever the last 3 pair i purchased fit in the waist and length but the rear and the legs look like they were sized for much larger jeans describing them as baggy is an under statement i have found another brand that fit and i will not be buying these again lee s quality control is not what it used to be i would not recommend these to anyone who is average sized if you are on the larger size husky then maybe these are for you i ordered 3 pairs of the same style and same size jean extremely disappointed when each pair was cut differently in both length and leg width i had to take them to a local tailor to shorten inseam and taper the legs to get a uniform fit when you order the same size and style you would think they would all fit the same sadly that was not the case have no idea where you have outsourced the sewing of this product but they are lacking in quality control regarding size my husband has worn these jeans for years but like everything else in our lives the corporation has decided to change the fit these jeans are advertised as fitting at the waist but this is no longer true for those that have long waist these jeans no longer fit like the previous jeans fit very disappointed in the new fit and had to return them i have worn lee regular fit jeans for decades and had loved them but the latest ones i recently purchased disappoint me i ordered them on line and immediately noticed they were way too loose in the waste i returned them and ordered a few pairs in different sizes they re okay but stretch out a bit while wearing them i miss the previous way they were made without so much stretch since i received them i ve been searching everywhere for different brand of jeans that look similar but aren t stretchy like women s jeans also i like them in light blue and the only place i can find them in that color is on line i have multiple pairs of lee jeans regular fit that i have purchased in the past these lee jeans regular fit are no where near the same quality the fabric is much cheaper lighter weight cotton the length is way off the overall fit is not the same looks like lee sacrificed quality to increased profit margin shame my jeans are hands down the best jeans on the market today quality product great selection of options quality materials and absolutely the best pricing out of any denim jean brand i m a fan because they still make relaxed fit and for someone who goes to the gym and exercises regularly like i do that extra little bit of room makes the difference of being comfortable or not a i like that they re a perfect fit loose not too tight they re just as i like them i really like this particular style in the wylie color and keep buying them they are softer than the other normal blue jeans i don t know why i have worn lee jeans since i was 12 years old that is for 55 years i started then because they always fit as purchased requiring no shrinking to fit as did levi s today they continue to

53,ORORO Men's Heated Jacket Kit With Detachable Hood and Battery Pack,135.99,0.0,250.0,excellent deal for the price i really like this jacket now a believer great quality nice materials open box men s classic heated jacket slick looking and so warm i didn t like it open box purchase we are lovin it best jacket i own comfortable great jacket but size is off great for riding havent received order yet much needed on a cold day,good materials warm i m happy i can t even give your company 1 star because i ordered a jacket for my son nearly a month ago that never came i asked for a refund a few days ago and am still waiting for that refund to be deposited into my bank account i am more than frustrated w your company my son works outside during the chicago winters and i was planning on ordering more products for him not only will i not be ordering anything i will tell everyone i know not to order from you as well i was able to receive what i ordered i charged the battery and it works great cant wait to try it out when the weather gets too cold pros excellent construction and design nifty and easy to use battery is hardly noticeable when stored in jacket pocket accessories such as bag charger and instruction manual looks good and not cheap looking warm and toasty jacket the hood is something that i like it keeps the cold and wind off of my neck and head i purchased a heated vest for my wife first she likes it so much i decided to buy myself the jacket it keeps me warm and comfortable i will purchase another battery or two since my wife uses mine also thanks ororo i was never a fan of the idea of a heated jacket it seemed like there was too much to go wrong or that without power it would not be viable i was surprised after getting my jacket i was happy with how warm it was without turning it on and then as it got cold i was impressed with the amount of heat it put out this is truly a jacket that will keep you warm even in michigan cold winds i probably won t need to wear the jacket for another month or so it won t really get cold in my area til january february and march next year i m a small person and it is sightly big on me but i ll probably be wearing a sweatshirt also so it ll be fine i ll try to update my experience with it later thanks i am very pleased with this jacket went on a bike ride in the rain and it kept me completely dry and warm i carry it in my panniers as needed love and absolutely recommend it thank you ororo i like the look and like all of ororo gear works good the only downside is flaws in the stitching you may notice flaws but nothing major though for the price i would expect better quality inspection of the final product i chose the small size wich is the smallest but the sleeves are too long and the whole jacket is too wide it is like a large for me also the delivery was about 5 days late it is a good quality jaket though looks like high quality the online ad says that its supposed to have a battery pack but its just the coat i probably could have contacted seller to figure out but found a cheaper brand elsewhere i bought multiple jackets from an open box purchase and had problems with multiple batteries not working or losing charge quickly luckily i had batteries from previous purchases to switch out to my hubby loves it it s better than all his other jackets keeps him warm without being too hot and is some how breathable ororo did some crazy magic with this jacket i m getting their heated socks later thank you so much i work on tower cranes for a living and this coat over a sweatshirt or vice versa is beautiful combination blocks the wind and keeps me very warm even with the jacket turned off i recommend it to everyone i meet who wants a heated jacket normally wear a large but got medium based off reviews of being larger sized and fits perfect seems to work good will find out when i start using it how well it works and how long it lasts i just wore my jacket for the first time it works well i bought a large jacket the body fits loosely but ok my problem is i have to roll the sleeves up on the plus side the extra long sleeves mean that i do not need to wear gloves i use this all winter except at work i love it comfortable light and slightly durable i even use it on the bike and it handles the wind very well i like it so much that i bought the vest for cool spring and fall days if you re having issues return it because it s a great jacket i ordered this bundle on oct 27 and was supposed to arrive 0ct 31 here it is nov 2 and received it yet i brought one jacket for golfing it was wo wonderful warm i had to buy another one for my job at the post office sure keeps me warm ororo gets 5 stars in my personal opinion i must say the customer service is great their communication is really fast and direct no issues with the service thanks is for the super fast free shipping my heated ororo jacket is what i need to keep me warm when l m outside i m so lucky and happy to have this for the fall winter seasons here in northeast pa thanks again jason m the jacket is very well made fit and does not restrict you i like the location of the battery as it doesn t bulk up in the pockets of the jacket the best feature i like about the jacket is the 4 heating levels you can adjust accordingly if you later or if you like in ca where you just need of for the hockey rinks yes we play ice hockey in ca you won t be disappointed with this well made jacket,men's clothing,0
54,Fruit of The loom Men's Waffle Baselayer Henley Thermal Top,7.97,4.4,155.0,fits great looks great a good looking thermal baselayer shirt great for cool and very cold weather fruit of the loom waffle shirt henley nice flexible top waffle thermal henley a must for the winter months warm henley shirt soft lightweight thermal good shirt fit could be better decent winter wear fruit of the loom men s classic waffle thermal a nice undershirt for winter great shirt thermal shirt thin material great classic name brand thermals fits like a glove keep warm this winter thermal underwear season is about here,this is a review of the fruit of the loom men s soft waffle baselayer henley thermal underwear for men i was quite surprised by the fit of this thermal shirt i m 6 3 tall 200 pounds and this shirt is a large but it fits very well sure i don t have the body to model this shirt so you ll have to forgive me for the photos i have long arms and these sleeves fit great and the tail is cut square and is long enough to wear out or to tuck in and when you bend over it doesn t crawl up your back it stays put and doesn t expose your backside it has 3 buttons at the neck and looks good enough on its own if you want to wear it as a shirt i would like to tell you that it will keep you nice and warm in cold weather but we re still over 100 degrees here in arizona so it s tough to tell you just how well it will work when it s cold the selling point of this shirt is that it s a henley the three button front makes it a presentable baselayer and not another ugly generic undershirt you want to keep hidden the grey coloring is light and the not typical dark grey the shirt is made up of 54 percent cotton and 46 percent that combines to make a soft and comfortable wear see attached photo of label right now here in florida it s the middle of summer so it s impossible for me to accurately say if this ll keep you warm in the middle of an arctic winter instead i can say this shirt is comfortable stylish and cool enough to be worn indoors thank you air conditioning during the warm summer florida months my only complaint would be that it has a generous cut i received a size large my normal size yet it fits loosely if used as a baselayer it should have a tighter fit so perhaps consider this when ordering this is my review of the fruit of the loom men s classic waffle thermal henley shirt i usually wear these shirts during the winter months under another shirt this time of year i will wear it as my only shirt because they look very nice they are completely warm to wear as a only shirt when the weather starts to get cool and can handle the very cold weather under another shirt and coat when real winter sets in fruit of the loom men s classic are always a great quality material and fit nicely one thing about thermal clothing you want it to fit well the quality of fruit of the loom has always been good and they continue to hold up while other makers of thermal clothing are starting to be less good in their final made quality the sleeves fit nice and are the correct length and the buttons do not pop off after a couple of washes i have the grey but have purchased the black and dark blue previously they all have maintained their quality and color appearance over the years just a nice addition to your causal wear and a get addition to your layer when the weather is freezing outside would recommend this shirt this is a very soft shirt warm but not hot it breathes very well for maximum comfort it is stylish as well as serving as a undergarment or could be used as a pajama top it is very well constructed color gives many options as to purpose would recommend too anyone i suppose a woman might wear if dressed in the right clothes august may be the wrong month for thermal underwear but you do have to plan for the cold days ahead this top fits well and would stretch comfortably for a larger person the sleeves are cuffed and the neck has three large buttons it is lightweight and would allow for layering with a tee shirt i anticipate wearing this top with a flannel shirt left unbuttoned in the cold it should provide the heat you need and once inside you could remove the flannel shirt and still loo presentable in a casual way this top does not look like underwear great thermal shirt by fruit of the loom not bulky and cumbersome as others have been lightweight and comfortable doesn t bind at the neckline from shoulders to wrist bands perfect set around chest and midriff are great pleasantly surprised easy maintenance and upkeep weather warren plain or with a shirt over it provides a great look easy to tuck in and stay in place now that s a perk you just couldn t ask for better made by a company who you can trust quality timeless piece of clothing material i received the fruit of the loom men s classic waffle thermal henley shirt to give my honest opinion but i have had the same thermal shirt for a couple of years now and unfortunately it s all worn out so when i came across this offer i knew i had to take advantage of it i m about 5 7 5 8 and about 125 135 pounds i must admit size medium fits me precisely some of the things i like about the fruit of the loom men s classic waffle thermal henley shirt is that it is machine washable retains heat cotton rich fabric and its stretchable one of the unique qualities of this thermal henley shirt is it is built for the winter even though it is not an expensive puffer jacket don t get carried away because the fruit of the loom men s classic waffle thermal henley shirt can retain heat because it can retain heat i noticed whenever i wear a thermal under my thin sweater during winter i am kept warm throughout the day but to conclude i am a fan of the fruit of the loom brand and would recommend the fruit of the loom men s classic waffle thermal henley shirt to anyone who wants to stay warm during the winter months at an affordable price this review is for a fruit of the loom men s classic waffle thermal henley shirt this shirt is lightweight yet strong enough to stretch with you and the three button henley option keeps me from feeling choked the shirts are more polyester than cotton but still shrink some after washing and drying so make your size choices accordingly the waffling of the material is what keeps you warm all the while wicking moisture away from your skin which also aids in staying warm i do like the elastic cuff on each arm that aids in keeping the sleeve from wadding up around your elbows the only complaint that i have is the length i m 6 3 200 lbs and they are a little short for my particular situation there are ample color choices for me as these are normally worn under another shirt so huge color choices are not as important to me as is warmth and comfort i think one of my favorite features is the tagless technology no more scratching on the back of my neck i can physically see the tag that appears to be printed on the inside but never bleeds through so it s not visible from the outside of the shirt i recommend these shirts if you need to stay warm and dry nice fall early spring thermal layer not too thick not too lightweight length on large seemed a little shorter than i would like while the arms seemed baggy washing it in warm water seemed to shrink the arms more than the length so it ended up working out well ends did not fray after wash like some other thermals i have owned the shirt is decent quality though personally i d prefer something a bit softer with a better fit perhaps it s the freedom that i like from wearing short sleeved tees but the thermal shirt does fit snugly and would definitely keep me warm during those cold evenings though this being the summer months it s still be pretty warm out i like the waffle pattern and overall feel but the fit for some reason feels just a tad unnatural most likely my personal body build all in all the three buttons in front are nice and it s a good shirt this shirt looks great but the size is a bit inaccurate compared to most of my clothes as it fits a big too snug i normally wear large shirts whereas this shirt would probably fit better in extra large the the fabric is also bit rough the to point that i might want to wear a softer t shirt underneath this i can t judge how much protection it gives against cold weather because it 100 degrees here fruit of the loom men s classic waffle thermal henley shirt fits well fits nice without any trouble to the skin very soft and easy fit maintains temperature and would be a great addition to winter wear this is a great combo to go along with any full or half shirts during winter men would love to wear this under their shirts or t shirts living in minnesota the winters get quite cold this fruit of the loom henley waffle shirt will help keep the cold out and still have a nice warm comfortable feel the look is good the comfort is quite nice the fit is perfect i like the price also i normally use ordinary fruit of the loom t shirts and am quite happy with those this t shirt works as a shirt by itself i think because of the style and color or an undershirt for the cold winters out of the package it has a strong smell so i have to wash before i can wear i know its recommended to wash all clothing before using it however i like to wear new clothes before washing while they are in perfect condition dress shirts are one example fruit of the loom is an expert in this line of clothing and in this specific case its a very nice t shirt that will keep you warm and comfortable during the cold or you could even wear this by itself in the summer season i would recommend 96 cotton 4 polyester okay i have to be honest here i asked for an xl shirt but got a medium my sweetie saw it and wanted to try it out now i will never get it back this shirt is so soft she just loves it she wears it as a sleep shirt i can t imagine it would look half as good on me here is my advice order two one your size and one for your sweetheart you can thank me later i received this shirt last week and even so it is in the 90 s decided to try it on i like the way it looks and the way it hangs i will be heading back to look for this henley shirt and see what color options are available for this upcoming winter this being a fruit of the loom item i knew this was going to be a quality product but upon wearing it it was so tight on me because this was a medium size shirt i was suppose to have received a large but i receive a medium and it s so tight on me i gave it to my wife to wear and she like s it the shirt material is thin and can almost see through it and i know the first time washing it it will shrink so those who are thinking about purchasing this item make sure it s a extra size up or more i truly like this item but i deduct a star for the sizing of the shirt if i wear a large i would go up to a extra large i do like wearing thermal s during the fall and winter months and this being a henley style shirt you could wear to any indoor outdoor event while looking good and staying warm at the same time made in el salvador with 65 polyester and 35 cotton this fruit of the loom thermal top is warm it is the original waffle type of long sleeve underwear there are buttons on the front for ease of putting the top on very comfortable even with an outer shirt movement is smooth no thickness to stop me from doing my regular routine but very warming and insulated well the black is nice even after a washing the color holds quite even no fading no pilling just nice thermal top the sleeves are a nice length for my 34 arms no riding up too short i can tuck the bottom in because the top is long enough or leave it out and it looks great i wear thermals every winter to keep my joints warm so no arthritis starts ever mine are medium with a good sizing that neither shrinks or fades i will buy more of this brand great name brand fruit of the loom equals quality as they have many years i have used the fruit of the loom brand henley s for about 15 years and they have always kept me warm and have been durable this material is very soft and looks like the mesh design has been reduced or tighten to a smaller pattern i have one that i bought two years ago and did a side by side comparison the collar has been increased to one inch from the three quarters that my two year old top has the stitching seems more robust in the neck area and on the back side of the button area the button area seems to have widen slightly also the waist area has also had a increase in stitching the cuff area has seen a big increase in the cuff from slightly over two inches to over three inches on the new top that should decrease the amount of arm slide from the top i did try the top on and it did fit like a glove after washing in cold and drying on low i did not notice any shrinkage in the fit or any odd bunching from the material the material is very comfortable on the skin the fruit of the loon men s classic waffle thermal henley shirt is the most comfortable thermal shirt i have ever worn the waffle design is fantastic and it looks good even though no one will be able to see it during the cold days for it will be under a shirt and jacket the design and comfort of this thermal shirt is a must for those that want to keep warm on those cold days the men s soft waffle baselayer henley thermal underwear by fruit of a loom is a must have the winter months are about here they are soft and will keep you warm they fit well and are styelish i would even wear them as outer clothing,men's clothing,0

stretch fabric the moisture wicking keeps you dry and feeling cool and the roll resistant color is perfect to stay in place at all times the upf 15 sun control means no harmful rays and i have never had a shirt with this extra added it is so convenient very control for a thick fabric this review was collected as part of a promotion comfortable cool and casual i really like the style and feel of the shirt it s a polo without the prep which is hard to find in this type of shirt the only thing i don t like is that is a little too linfband wide at the bottom everything else fits great i m going to wash and dry it hoping it will shrink a little i m 5 9 175lbs size medium this review was collected as part of a promotion i wear polos a lot i find them a nice balance between the comfort of a t shirt and the formality of a shirt so they re my way to go for active smart work enviroment what i like about this brand is its simplicity and good craftsmanship the neck doesn t roll up and the materials and finishing are top notch if you add that to the no fuss design and the nice looking logo you get a great product that for the price has no rival i mean it has the same quality of other brands which are 2 3x times the price now what i didn t like fitting seems to be on the big side i usually wear m for tight fit and l for a loose comfort fit i got this polo on an m and even though the chest and arms fitting is spot on it is kind of loose on the belly and it s also quite long this review was collected as part of a promotion i really like the look and it is very comfortable to wear the fabric is stretchy so it will not be tight it is well tailored and made well this review was collected as part of a promotion beautiful color and the fit is excellent it fits just right i love the vibrant color and the great quality of the material uou can pair it with any color pants this review was collected as part of a promotion i really like my izod advantage sportflex classic fit performance polo the fit is good nd the shirt is very comfortable great for everyday or business casual look this review was collected as part of a promotion i love this shirt great color combination very soft and comfortable this review was collected as part of a promotion my boyfriend loved it an thought it was very comfertable this review was collected as part of a promotion while it s not the nicest fabric in the world and i seriously question its durability it s hard to beat the price for a solid looking comfortable polo shirt it truly does match it s sport or performance label stretchy fabric sweat dries quickly from it the collar stays flat and the upf protection is nice i could do without the someone tacky looking embroidery on the front breast area but it s relatively small and non descript this review was collected as part of a promotion this shirt has been well used during this summer i found the shirt to be a good fit i was being able to easily move around because of how well the fabric stretched wearing the shirt on hot days hasn t been a problem i was able to stay comfortable although it s not the thinnest material the shirt seemed well insulated and protected me from the hot sun this review was collected as part of a promotion got this nice polo shirt a month ago the izod advantage sportflex classic fit performance polo is comfortable and will be a polo i keep in my work shirt rotation i wish the coller didn t crease so easily though this review was collected as part of a promotion i received this item about a month ago and have worn it on several occasions now i feel not only comfortable but also stylish this is a piece of clothing that i can wear for a casual outing but also look good in i would definitely suggest this to anyone this review

58,Wrangler Men's Comfort Solution Series Cargo Pants,23.87,4.5,411.0,the best husband loves them cargo pants great pants yes i would buy again comfortable and stretchy forgiving stretch waist and leg material almost perfect are these pants for left handed people great pants favorite great pants my go to pants functional and comfortable great pants nice but i like the ones without flaps better very comfortable these pants are similar to other wrangler cargo pants,love these pants rich colors great fit allowed me to order size 32 with a little extra stretch when i normally wear a size 33 i ll be ordering two more they almost look like dress pants yet they re cargo pants they feel real comfortable to wear and look very good second time we ve purchased these for my husband and he loves them comfort waistband is great they really hold up to rugged wear fishing working around the yard etc well made pants what can i say love the cargo pockets perfect fit for my cell phone and my wallet i bought two 2 pair and the price was rite and not the game show lol these pants are very nice and my husband loves them they fit great and feel great they are super nice but not expensive i priced other name brands and they weren t as nice as these and more expensive these are well worth the money the tech pocket on all my other wrangler pants and jeans is located on the left side the tech pocket on this new model is on the right side ok some want it on the right and some want it on the left so have it on both sides it cannot cost that much more otherwise the comfort waist band is very comfortable and why not have camouflage choices again stretchy enough for work very comfortable and the waist band is very comfortable a little more expensive here than i usually pay but worth the money in comfort i ve not been able to purchase at a local walmart so the convenience of online was a big positive however you can t feel nor try them on until received the material is a lighter weight than the previous canvas like pant the waist and fabric is of an expandable stretch nature allowing that extra helping at thanksgiving the side leg pockets are large and due to extra pleating can expand for a lot of things drawback is walking clearance as the pocket has expanded significantly the rear pockets are not as deep as the canvas material wranglers i have currently drawback my wallet tends to catch and drop out when sitting on an open lower back chair i love how comfortable they are at work i wish the side pockets were a little smaller and had snaps instead of velcro ive purchased several pairs and will continue to do so until i find something better pants are great shipping took longer than expected because fedex won t deliver on time tracking will show package is on truck for delivery but they won t deliver for 3 4 days after expected delivery please use usps instead fedex does this every time i order something these are more cheaply made pockets are white cloth and come out all the time when taking your hand out etc and the tech phone pocket is on the wrong right side are these pants for left handed people good pants at a good price color selection was good if you are between sizes the waistband will give enough to fit definitely like that feature favorite work pants used to buy these in the store but now the store only carries the tapered fit so happy to find these on the website good pants at a great price if you are between sizes the waistband will give enough to fit definitely like that feature very comfortable and versatile at the same time and for around 20 it s probably the best value around i am a woman who buys mens cargo pants i need them for work and womens pants have useless pockets these are comfortable and functional not gonna lie these are probably the best pair of pants i own they re comfortable light but durable and though a little stretchy on the top nothing a decent belt can t fix i will probably get a few more of these in the future lol they fit well and look good walmart also offers similar cargo pants w o the flaps and uses zippers i like that look much better and bought several of them similar price these pants are made of a light weight stretch fabric that is very comfortable my only complaint is that i could only get them in my size in the tan color not my favorite between the soft material stench waste band and the loose fit these are very comfortable cargo pants some may find these to be a little too lose all pockets are roomy the only problem for me is the tech pocket is a little too big for my phone so my phone has a tendency to lip out i had 4 pairs of wrangler cargo pants so am familiar with the product like anyone else i would not have purchased unless i was very satisfied with the ones i have this pant is different in 2 ways to me it has a stretchy waist which i like very much the phone pocket is on the right rather than the left which makes no difference to me,men's clothing,0

70,Hanes SUPER VALUE 10 PACK White Crew ComfortSoft T-Shirts,22.28,4.3,1008.0,a basic white t my favorite t shirt replacing old with new not satisfied not long enough shrink more when washed necks were incredibly stretched out giving hanes a bad reputation junk t shirts nice shirts price not so v bad told it like it is exactly what i expected white t shirt below par excellent value where s the length transitioning very comfortable at great price,hanes t shirts are comfortable and correctly sized but thin perfect for summer and working outside in the yard but these really are more like an undershirt and not entirely appropriate for wearing in public call me old fashioned but seeing a man s chest hair through his shirt is kind of gross i have purchased 2 hanes men s comfortsoft white crewneck t shirt super value 10 packs on july 11 2020 they were excellent items i like them a lot i like to shop walmart com for everyday low prices free shipping on orders 35 or pickup in store and get a pickup discount i love walmart com a lot very happy with this purchase the t shirts are 100 percent cotton lightweight comfortable breathable and the price was awesome i found this great deal and took advantage of it i received them in a orderly time frame and i love them the reason i m giving 3 stars i m being kind the shirt does not fit the way the picture looks it doesn t fit up under your arms it hangs down it says x large it s long and not wide x large when you wash them it in cold water they shrink up and loses its shape so they are exactly as pictured basic white men s undershirts however they are very thin cotton material and neckline summer in md so i m not complaining and they stain and shrink very easily that said if you need them for casual loose day shirts or a tie dye project or light undershirts they re perfect just give em a good stretch when they come out of the dryer they are soft but they really shrink in the length when washed and dried for an xl size they really weren t long enough before washing disappointed in product beware the necks of all of these shirts were stretched out beyond belief when i received them none were tight around the neck whatsoever the photo doesn t show the back of the neck where the spread of the fabric is most remarkable although the name of the tshirt are hanes tha quality is not the same as the hanes that i got from the store in the middle of last year they are thin and flimsy the only reason for me not returning them was because my husband says that they may be good for sleeping only bad quality for the name after first wash they shrunk up and i can no longer wear them i would not recommend them or purchase them again why are 2xl undershirts now considered big mens shirts with twice the price tag nthis is not an un common size there is a place in the store in fact every store not just walmart the 2xl size is always empty stores do not buy enough to keep up with the demand i dont know who sewed these misshapen shirts but they did an awful job the necks all had a hug lump in them at the top like they had sewed in electra material also the fold crease that runs down the middle of these shirts will never go away never iron wash wait a year it doesn t matter it will never go away the size is the standard size after wash i kind of regret that i bought a size smaller but they are still good to wear the t shirts are on the thin side good to wear in the summer days very skimpy sleeves kinda short short in the body my fault should not buy lesser brand got cheap but now the brand i bought for years jockey is tracking me and with deals what the heck nmy father always told me not go cheap on shoes and underwear nstay safe nole don born in 1943 its exactly what i expected so thats good thing i mean its a white t shirt my husband wears under his work button down as well as his dress button downs my husband has worn this brand of tshirts for many years this is the first time he has been unhappy with them they are uncomfortable rough fabric and are too thin excellent use and well made washed beautifully in cold water and not dried too much nworth the money would definitely buy these tee shirts again when needed shirts are plenty wide but really short once washed they shrink up pretty good i don t wear 3x but had to buy 3x in these hoping they would still fit after washing them after shrinking the width is now perfect but the length is really short making it hard to tuck in my 12 year old son is growing up fast he is in that stage where he is transitioning out of boy clothes into men clothing was not to sure about the size however to my surprise fits like a charm great look made my little man feel like he is a big boy these are exceptionally comfortable and for a great price they are thinner than others and the sleeves are a bit shorter than others while still having good room in the shoulders all of which i find improve the comfort the material feels good too i plan to buy more of these,men's clothing,0

75,Alpine Swiss 6 Pack Mens Cotton Dress Socks Mid Calf Argyle Pattern Solids Set,9.99,4.7,169.0,high quality durable nice looking great socks soft comfort and quality socks cool patterns fine quality to these dress socks perfect socks for guys with style great deal bright color argyle socks run small will buy again great great ordered more,haven t had any dress occasions lately so i creatively repurposed these socks for everyday use they are a cotton polyester blend and manage sweat well i daily have used them heavily with everyday shoes work boots hiking boots and inline skates in the latter case i found these seem much like the thin smooth 16 inline skating specialty socks so i used them for that purpose on several occasions i also wore them inside heavier socks with work and hiking boots used them alone with everyday shoes have done a lot of heavy action with these socks and am extremely satisfied with them in fact i will choose this type of sock from now on for both dress and every day usage after my repurposing beside the inline skating i ve taken many tens of thousands of hard steps with these socks they are durable significantly the smooth finish is great for preventing blisters the most important feature i will also use them for inline skating from now instead of the similar feeling expensive specialty socks they may not last as long in that usage as the specialty socks but after my experience i feel they ll work well for lighter duty dress occasions i figure they will last many years plus they look perfect for that usage i chose the conservative solid color pack but you have a choice of two other flavors to suit hi i love the wild pattern socks this is all i wear this is just another brand and i can tell the difference between a good pair and bad ones the bad ones i have had in the past might look cool with the wild patterns but some fit better then others there are loose threads inside that you have to break to get you feet in them now these mid calf socks from walmart are great fitting no loose threads they are light enough for summer use or warm enough for a cold night you get 6 pair in a package every pair is a different pattern they are so comfy i cant get over it nothing cheap about these socks and they get noticed too i would not hesitate to buy more on these but getting 6 pair in a package is about enough for each day of the week before washing time i really like the high fit compared to those low cut socks you feel you have to pull up all the time do your self a favor and treat you self or some to 6 pair of these socks if they like loud patterns then these fit the bill these alpine swiss six pack of socks are perfect and just what i needed for wearing with my new boots i am looking forward to this winter to make good use of them they will also do well to be worn with dress or sport shoes just the same they are totally soft and warm yet not too thick which is perfect i really like the variety i got plaids and solids of dark colors though these are men s socks i don t mind about that as they fit just fine and are snug enough i wear a women s size 9 13 sock normally they feel lightweight and comfortable on my foot the toes and heels are sturdy as well and will last and no holes means no repairs and will last for years to come i can recommend them as a good investment and at such a reasonable price can say they are of great value the quality and excellence of materials used is exceptional they are seventy three percent cotton and that really matters to me regarding feet sweating as the cotton absorbs excess perspiration there is nothing more important than comfort in footwear so you can add these to your collection in full confidence fyi these socks are 73 cotton 26 polyester 1 elastane they are all patterns nice ones no solids in my package not sure why they say men s to me they re unisex see pic very nice these socks are fine quality 1st not onion skin thickness the way some dress socks are and 2and not tight as an i ll fitting glove the way some dress socks can be thick enough to be comfortable and not too thick wide enough to fit nicely and not too wide i will be ordering more of these i ordered them for one guy and 3 others wanted them too great socks at amazing price great socks at great price if you like bright colors and patterns on your dress socks you have found the product for you i have a size 11 foot and they fit great a mixture of cotton and polyester the are thin like dress socks and a comfortable fit it s fun to be a little bold and have a bright color and pattern sock under your dress slacks or suite they also fit in my boots great they are mens socks i bought them for my self a woman i just like crazy fun socks however my only concern is they run small they fit perfect right now even though i got a larger men size i don t dare put them in the dryer if they shrink even a little they will be way to tight quality is ok but i won t buy any more colorful and seems to be well constructed tried buying them for ladies for under slacks dont top is way way too binding and cuts off your circulation had to return i bought these for my daughter she wears a 9 exellent socks very soft y confotable love the style and the fit great colors designs soft great price for fast delivery quality designs and price are all here my husband loves these theyre nice and light and comfortable liked very much look great feel good nice gift,men's clothing,1

77,AlpineSwiss Niko Packable Light Mens Down Alternative Puffer Jacket Bubble Coat,27.99,4.2,128.0,must have for cooler weather so warm warm soft warm and lightweight beautiful jacket light but warm great coat with inside pockets perfect for fall excellent product quality fits well warm lightweight great fit light weight very warm coat so warm cozy coat awesome jacket i like it fantastic deal great quality jacket,what a great jacket i use it for evening walks and i can t say good enough things as we have been down into the teens the evenings have been quite brisk but this jacket keeps me consistently warm also i like how it fits it s not right fitting but it does fit nicely and not baggy looks great and keeps me warm my husband absolutely loves this jacket it s very light weight but can keep anyone incredibly warm it was 30 degrees last night and my husband wore his coat while taking our daughter trick or treating he was so toasty and warm the entire night we travel quite frequently i love that the coat is easy to pack and it takes up very little room definitely purchasing more from this brand this is my first down or down alternative jacket i once had a down down comforter and it is difficult to describe the down or down alternative experience it is like it is heavy think dense but light weight all at the same time i remember my down or down alternative comforter was expensive it was also luxurious and felt expensive the same is true of this jacket i also remember my down or down alternative comforter was so great at being compressed for storage and so is this jacket this will be my go to coat to pack when travelling it does not make you feel like it is too bulky especially given how much warmth it provides you the first time i wore it my husband was wearing his regular winter coat it was quite cold out our first snow flakes of the year were falling but it was the wind that was killing us he was still chilled while i was nice and toasty the water resistance was nice as the snow pellets were melting as soon as they hit me i love love love that this jacket is machine washable nice sized pockets held my phone and keys perfectly i am writing this review on the niko menu2019s down jacket puffer bubble coat packable light warm parka this jacket is great super warm it s in 20 degrees farenheit here and this keeps me plenty warm outside and its roomy enough i could put another layer on beneath it i like the style as well i highly recommend this jacket for winter or cold weather outings i received this product for review purposes and absolutely love the beautiful color the quality is very good and it s very light weight it s true to its size pretty much so if you want to wear sweaters under go up a size just to be comfy i d recommend to anyone looking for this type of product this jacket it light weight warm and looks great we had our first snow today and my husband reported being nice and warm in his new coat the only issue he had is he wishes the sleeves were a bit tighter on the wrists as they seem strangely loose but overall nice jacket with a good fit my fianc e loves this coat because of the inside pockets he can put his phone in the pocket and does not have to worry about it falling out he stated it is comfortable and stylist he only wish it had a hood on it but he stated he will wear a hat it remains me of a coat from the 90 s and i love the inside pockets also i haven t had a coat with those in forever great design this is a very light weight fall jacket well make stitching seems good it has two pockets on the sides and both have zippers on them quality of the zippers is really impressive color is really elegant it has elastic on tbw waist line and that stop the cold air to get to you i haven t seen that in adult size jackets fitting is perfect would highly recommend it i saw this parka and thought it would be perfect for husband and it has become his absolute favorite jacket the weather is getting cooler and he leaves so early in the morning he needs something to keep him warm we live in a predominantly warmer climate so heavy winter coats aren t really necessary 11 months out of the year this jacket is the perfect weight that he can wear outside on the colder days without sweating but still staying very warm the fact that it is so light makes it a perfect jacket he hates having to lug around a heavy jacket and this one is so light it packs very well as it is easily compressed which makes it an essential piece for any vacation another big plus is it won t come out wrinkly when you unpack it either you can tell by the look and feel of this jacket that it is made of quality materials and will hold up to lots of wear year after year the fit was true to size but still allowed room for layering without looking too bulky or loose without layers the zippers are nice size and perfect quality the jacket looks very handsome on him he loves all the pockets this jacket has been his go to jacket he reaches for overall my husband is very happy and my husband loves his new jacket very comfortable and warm jacket also very light weight i was surprised how light weight this jacket is and yet manages to keep me very warm the only issue i have with the jacket is the zipper on the pockets when i put my hands into the jacket pocket it scratches my arm quite a bit i knocked off one star for that but overall a high quality jacket my husband has ten black coats so i made him venture out with the green niko puffer jacket the photo online did look like a deeper hunter green but when i received it it almost looked black but it does have a nice touch of dark green the jacket is super thin but my husband said kept him very warm he is typically a large jacket and the large fit him perfectly there is a nice elastic bottom so it s not like wearing a box the fabric is soft we live in chicago so it was perfect for the first snowy day this niko down alternative puffer jacket by alpine swiss is a super nice jacket it s really light weight but yet very warm and i can t stress enough just how super soft this jacket is i love it and so does my husband he said it s one of the most comfortable jackets he s ever worn he said because it s so soft and light weight you can move freely and he d have no problem even living in it it s winter here and he also said it s warm even out in the wind we got a size mens medium and it seems to be true to size my husband normally wears a size medium and this fits him very nicely the material is excellent quality and the stitches are all tight just a good quality jacket in general the jacket has thin elastic on the bottom of the jacket and on the bottom of both sleeves it has two zippered side pockets i m very tempted to steal this away from him and keep it for myself i have been using this jacket pretty much every day it has started to get cold where i live and it s not too cold out so this jacket works great it does help keep you look at warm this not will heavy it is excellent pusher if there s wind or even if it s just a little brisk outside it s super comfortable and very moveable this jacket is so warm which is surprising since it s so light it has the warmth of a much thicker coat in a lightweight jacket my husband hates wearing coats and only wears jackets and pullovers so when it gets really cold he is always underdressed he happily wears this jacket because it isn t heavy like a winter coat he loves it it looks sleek and not bulky when on with christmas coming up this would make a great gift i am considering getting one for my mom as she also won t wear coats if you re looking for a jacket with the warmth of a coat that is comfy and stylish this is the one for you so very happy with it highly recommended this jacket is very lightweight and comfortable the material is very soft to the touch and isn t overstuffed the side pockets are a nice place for my phone and keys this coat is true to size you can easily wear long sleeves under it to accommodate the extreme cold it is nice quality and simple yet appealing the trim on the bottom helps to keep the heat in as it keeps it closer to your body received it and it works perfect made very well and looks great love the color and it isn t very bulky the zipper is very well made and very easy to use very light very warm especially for the weight i like it better than the 70 similar jacket it s replacing but from that experience i would advise anyone with one of these ultralight jackets to avoid standing near a fireplace for any length of time it s not a pretty sight this product is awesome it keeps me warm in cold wet and windy conditions it is water resistant anything in the pockets are kept perfectly dry in rain high quality materials as well and an even better price i am 6ft 3 have a slim build and the xl fits me well the sleeves are not too short which is normally the case and it covers all shirts length wise i would recommend this to everyone 10 10 i but men s clothes as it fits a bigger women better and this is no exception hip area is a little tight on me but otherwise a fantastic buy always wanted a puffer coat and this fits the bill and the color is my favorite this is so well made and so comfortable true to size lightweight but very warm the prices is amazing for the quality you get,men's

84,"Hanes Sport Men's and Big Men's Short Sleeve Cool Dri Performance Tee (50+ UPF), Up to Size 3XL",7.89,4.6,1725.0,great shirt cool dry comfort great fabric great shirts great product keeps you cool love the hanes cool dri shirt great product fine and dandy so far ehh meh great tee but has a major flaw don t waste your time shop amazon does the size fit change between batches comfortably living in hanes sport cool dri tshirt staying comfortable under stress good value great deal the only tee for me,super soft light weight breathable thin a bit of a silky feel everything you can ask for when wanting to wear a shirt on an extremely hot day i only purchased one because i wanted to physically see this is my second order of these shirts i bought 3 last summer they are awesome in the fl summer heat got 3 more first 3 are still in great condition its the most comfortable shirts ive ever warn love the lightness of the shirt wonderfully made t shirts compliments the body totally i got these shirts for a friend who works in a warehouse loading trucks the temps are extremely hot and humid he wore these shirts i got 5 different colors and said they kept him cool and comfortable all day he highly recommends them to anyone who works in these conditions love the hanes cool dri shirt recently move to eastern nc these shirts are perfect for the heat and humidity of summer purchased 6 one of every available color in my size walmart has the best price when purchasing the 2 pack even cheaper than the manufacturer well made fabric it keeps you cool xl is an xl it fits me well i ordered a large first only to see that it just fits me too tight i use l for sleep shirt the hanes sport men s sort sleeve cool dri performance tees were as described there are no obvious manufacturing problems the color is a standard neon green yellow the picture for it on my monitor does not do it justice it gets four stars only because i haven t worn them long my experience with other neon shirts is that they stain really easily and lose their brilliance these have been hand washed without losing any of the brightness i ordered 5 of these 2 of which were white both of which were very dirty and not individually packaged as the other 3 were not happy with that aspect of it but the quality of the shirts aren t bad at all good quality fabric fit is good only issue is the seam on 3 of the 6 shirts i bought has started unraveling after only 2 washes that s not great the 3 hanes sport cool dri men s performance tees i purchased arrived quickly the sizing was perfect the material was just what i wanted and the price was a real value however i soon discovered one major flaw in all 3 the neckband of the tees stretched out with the first use have you seen those u neck commercials well that s what started to happen but not nearly as bad as in the commercial without the flaw i would have rated it a 5 5 hanes need to reinforce the neckband so this doesn t happen while the colors is very nice these shirts are not worth the time or money you spend i like to wash anything new before i ware it the shirts wrinkled in the first wash and to this day i ve not be able to get the wrinkles out they have been washed three times and still the wrinkles will not come out because of the type of material if i press them i m afraid they will melt they run small if you take them back to walmart they cannot take them back becomes they came from a third party seller and if you send them back it costs more than the cost of a shirt just buy it in the walmart store or order it from amazon where you can return with ease the quality of the fiber is good but i feel that there is a variation within the same size depending on the batch color or timing of the purchase i bought a fe medium perf tees in the past and bought again the new batch felt a little bit loose and slightly larger than medium bought a bunch of the cool dri tee shirts during the hottest and most humid summer of my life before buying these shirts i was changing tee shirts up to seven times a day due to the uncomfortable sweat buildup now i am more comfortable and the tee shirt i put on before i go out is the tge same one i take off when i get home it has done exactly what was needed i m an acute care nurse that needs shirts that will keep me cool and dry for 12 hours a day these meet the need very well they are soft and comfortable all day when i work up a sweat they dry quickly i couldn t ask from these shirts really like them shirts are great for the price they are i needed something that i could wear around the house on a hot day or go for a run in that was sweat wicking it is all i could want for that the only reason i gave a 4 is because one of the shirts came with snags in it super comfy and well made plus you cant beat the price hanes sport cool ddri men s performance tee is the onl tee shirt i would even consider wearing they are so light cool and feel like silk i am only sorry to see that the color choice is now limited and i have to start wearing the same color over i own this shirt as well as one of the starter dri star shirts sold by walmart for slightly more money i do not own any of the big name brands so my review will be a comparison to the starter shirt the fabric of the hanes is 100 polyester as is the starter shirt however the hanes shirt seems to be slightly thicker and less see thru the hanes shirt is more full cut and has a longer length while the starter shirt has a slimmer cut workmanship seems comparable i wear these shirts while playing table tennis and was able to saturate both shirts quite easily the moisture wicking ability of the hanes seems to be slightly better but neither shirt will keep you dry if you sweat a lot however both will dry faster than a 100 cotton t shirt overall i prefer the hanes to the starter shirt because the hanes is slightly less expensive and the material seems to be slightly better quality,men's clothing,0

97,"Hanes Men's and Big Men's ComfortWash Tank, Up To Size 3XL",6.0,4.3,738.0,price does not reflect the quality of this item cool and comfortable great tank good shirt horrible tag quality tank but too long won t fit if you have hips poor fit bad buy returned item outstanding customer service it s comfortable not for my shape wrong size garment dyed sleeveless tank top these look like they ve been washed 100 times big disappointment not worth the 10 excellent tank top,i purchased several in different colors to layer over women s tanks to wear while exercising the style and it are just what i was looking for fabric is soft stitching is even well made not some cheap looking or feeling product definitely recommend my son got these tank tops and loves them he a big guy and a lot of times the sizes are not a true fit these fit him the way he wanted them to he likes them a bit loose he liked all the colors available and received them earlier than expected which was perfect timing also walmart was the only store that had tank tops available this late in the season and at a great price i am a woman and wear a small medium in women s tops i bought this in medium due to it being 100 cotton it did shrink a little after washing and machine dry but was still too large especially in the arm holes i stitched it up under the arms and it fits now i think a small would do better otherwise the medium weight fabric is 100 cotton and feels great very comfortable and fit great but please tell whoever thought it was a good idea to put giant tags on the back of the shirt that no one wants those they are annoying and pointless if you have some sort of tag fetish then just put it in the inside bottom of the shirt enough with these giant hard to remove tags already took a star off just cause of that stupid tag these shirts are super comfy and seem to be built nice and tough i m very happy with the feel and quality of material and work they fit great in the chest and gut they are a bit long for the size though with running shorts they cover them with jeans i have to really pull up some material to get into my pockets i am disappointed in the tank fit it is nothing like the picture the straps are not as wide as pictured the armholes are huge and the bottom is tight over my hips i have to wear it bunched up at my waist i ordered a medium which is what i usually wear in a unisex shirt these are definitely cut for a man the material is soft but not see through and i like the color i wish they fit better these will be relegated to the sleep shirt pile the material is of good quality and is soft and sewn nicely i do not like the fit of the garment the top fits oddly around the front of the armholes towards the breast it gaps and does not look good i am dissapointed and was really hoping for a fit as nice as the material the shirt came very wrinkled and no tags on it it appears to be a used returned item new should have tags right how else do you bar code and scan that it s been purchased shipped etc i ve purchased clothes online before and they may have some wrinkles when they arrive where they are folded and shipped but this is wrinkled like it came out of someone s dirty clothes basket the pictures are a few minutes after i opened the package no plastic wrap no tags extremely disappointed and would not purchase again while i like the longer length and fabric of the shirt the armholes are huge i ordered a small and the shirt fits but looks like it stretched out under the arms i will probably sew a few quick seams up the sides to take them in instead of returning these shirt is quite heavy looks as though it runs small hope it doesn t shrink this shirt was an obvious return it was stuffed into the mailing bag no display bag or anything horribly crushed i note i was charged full price not very good customerr satisfaction practice i am very very disappointed am female and love these shirts for summer exercising and sleeping love the casual fit but wish it was cut a slightly wider on top of shoulders to hide bra strap yes i know it is men s shirt and they are not worried about hiding bra straps haha no one makes casual loose fitting cotton shirts for women so i found this in men s bought several colors love the pastels and so soft slightly obsessed all the colors were completely off from the pictures on the website everything else was fine but the colors ruined it the names of the colors accordingly to the website were accurate but not the color itself n nnevertheless the customer service is outstanding i couldn t be more please d n nthank you for offering a hassle free customer service d in this time and era an excellent customer service like yours it s what it keeps me loyal to your brand comfortable but for this gal the armholes are too big shows most bras my husband likes the one i got him i d give him mine but coral isn t his color the fabric and quality is great on these tanks but they really don t translate to my female body shape i haven t yet figured out how to modify them to fit but i m still working on it the t shirt is great but i ordered a large and they sent a men s large i saw large on the tag and thought it was a woman s size and washed it i m pretty sure they won t take it back but i have not contacted them the first ones i ordered where two times too big so i got a smaller size and they are almost too small the arm holes are not sewn right they stick out so after the second time i think i will cut my losses and not order any more these comfortwash tank tops look like they have been washed 100 times and they have a horrible itchy tag in them if i wanted some old tank top i would go to a second hand store i am very disappointed with the quality of this product it does not even say that it is a hanes product and it seems very small for an extra large overall definitely not worth the 10 i paid i was very disappointed with the quality of this item there is nothing to indicate that this is a genuine hanes article and if it is it is a far poor quality than i have ever purchased before definitely not worth the 10 paid for it i couldnt believe the high quality of these shirts at such a low price the colors are great and cheerful and the material is comfortable and the fit perfect walmart is the only way to go for tank tops,men's clothing,0

104,Vibes Men's Cargo Zipper Pocket Sweatpants Adjustable Bungee Cord open bottom,16.99,4.3,41.0,best pants for quality money and look top quality not baggy proper sizing durable relaxing fit almost perfect bad seller thick good value just what i was looking for i didn t get the vibes they told it was vibes great value and price i wish i had ordered more comfort sweats perfect fit true to size sweats very nice cargo pocket sweatpants schedule swearpants,these are a beautiful pair of top quality pants to wear that fit nicely and are not baggy giving a dressier look with quality side vertical zippers for the cargo area i actually prefer a top entrance cargo pocket but these are very nice both cargo pockets are 9 wide and 8 deep the pants are cotton and polyester with the outside being very tight and smooth and the inside being the softer fleece the outside has remained tight and smooth but the inside being softer do seem to have small pieces of the material that does come out when i remove them at night they re still new and haven t been washed yet the bottoms of the pant legs are fully adjustable with bungee cords but do leave the cord showing but not a problem some people have stated that the inner waist cord isn t long enough but i find it fits correctly with a inch solid flat drawstring and not the cheap thin type of rope material it leaves more than enough to tie a very solid bow tie that stays inside the pants making a smooth finished look if you are a medium build or have regular or thinner legs they ll fit without looking like balloon legs giving a slimmer normal look no they aren t slim cut just normal and comfortable they do make another pair having a looser fit with topside cargo pockets for the same price i have another pair of another pair that are cargo pants like these in fit and weighted both separately the vibes in medium weighed 12 ounces and my other pair new was lighter at 8 ounces the vibes just seem so much nicer quality i would recommend these pants for everyday wear because they re so well fitting and finished or for a gym workout i ve also ordered a second pair for backup these pants arrived by fedex on time and fit exactly according to size you can check their measurements for sizing med is 34 yo 36 inches soft tight weave cotton exterior polyester fleece interior i like the waist cord being inside so it doesn t show cord allows for tying without excessive slack for a better tailored look the zippers on the cargo area aren t on the top strong and well made but sideways for a classier more finished look these items must be washed with warm water gentle cycle and dried with a lower heat setting or air dried the length is proper and sits on the shoe properly but can be adjusted with the bungee cords the can stick out and become tangled so i tied them in a loop one side had a top slot to pass through the other didn t also i hate a baggy look around the top section and fit really nice and comfortable i like that i can wear them for everyday without looking like work out pants if you have a larger lower section and wide legs i suggest their other model with the relaxed fit and velcro closures i m going to buy another pair because i m crazy and want to have a back up pair in my closet they re 60 cotton 40 polyester greatest value quality for the money the only thing i did notice is that they don t include a contact number web address should you receive a wrong size or color that would make me feel more comfortable and confident about the seller so comfortable and fits perfectly will definitely be ordering more great fitting and durable absolutely comfortable definitely worth the order and came rather quickly very comfortable and warm fits well pleased these pants are well constructed and comfortable i gave four stars because the material was not prewashed and sheds incredibly on the inside i have purchased six pairs i didn t turn the first pair inside out when washed the first time and the black shed onto my grandson s socks recently i purchased two more pairs and washed one at a time inside out during the wash of the second pair the washer clogged and won t drain because of all the shedded material so be careful pants great on fit and style not baggy loose fit but a hole about 2 inches in the right pocket in the seam i placed an order for two pairs of jeans from this seller i was sent only one pair and charged for two i have tried several times to contact this seller but have gotten no response so now i m out money and pants these were way too thick they would be very hot perfect fit and very comfortable these are exactly what i was looking for sweatpants have three pockets one of what has a closure to keep keys and wallet safe the legs are not too wide so there isn t too much extra fabric ngood value for the money i didn t like the ones i order so i don t know about ones with two back pockets made out of acrylic i order them again hope this time i will get the right ones my boyfriend loves the pants to work in they are think like to wear in the winter but he s wearing them in the summer the pockets are great for holding tools and your phone good quality just wish i could get more colors in his size good for casual wear too sweatpants are well made and the pockets are so useful nthe zippered one are excellent for cell phones comfy and fit exactly as

107,"Hanes Men's and Big Men's Ultimate Cotton Heavyweight Fleece Full Zip Hood, up to Size 3XL",16.5,4.4,2502.0,white carolina blue hoodies very pleased hanes tactic great buy exactly what i was looking for cozy hoodie delivered with a flaw do not trust the photos quality is not great beware of yellow comfy perfect fit love this warped zipper perfect for spring and fall no good great product at a great price changes to quality disappointed awesome quality only red sweatshirt i could find gotta love em need more of em,i bought 2 white and 1 carolina blue all in xl and all 3 are super soft and fit great i used both whites for a diy tie dye project and they turned out really well delivery was also very timely will definitely be getting more colors we bought this to dona diy skeletor costume for our halloween skeleton decoration the material cut well and sharpie marker looks good on it i m pleased very good quality made very well material i loved so much i order hanes t shirts i d definitely recommend to anyone was a great hoodie was right size and cheaper than anyone else s prices thank you exactly as described comfy great fro htv designs affordable these hoodies are super cozy and hold up very well with lots of washing the added touch of sewing the hood string at the top so it doesnt get pulled out makes me happy i ordered 2 hoodies one was in good shape the other had one corner of the front pocket was sewn all the way through the back of the hoodie i had to cut it just to get it on i did not want to mess with mailing it back to return it so i just wear it with a flaw now this item is not what is pictured on the site the zipper and grommets are silver not color matched as shown i m quite disappointed the sweatshirt is just ok otherwise medium weight and hasn t pilled or shrunk in the wash yet catch it on sale and it s acceptable if you don t care how it looks wore it twice and the seam that cuffs the sleeve is already coming apart disappointed to say the least the color of this hoodie is absolutely nothing like the picture beware it deserves the one star because it actually is comfortable ordered 3 a red blue and green one all size small perfect fit all 3 teen girls have different body shapes and they still fit perfect they wanted them for halloween costume but they wear it almost everyday they say its so comfy i tie dye these are my go to for dying as they are tough comfy warm and take color well sizes run true the pullovers are great too buy without hesitation i love the fabric feel and the color navy blue but unfortunately the zipper is terribly warped it looks like i m smuggling a python totally unwearable these hoodies i bought one for me one for my husband and another for my adult son are just right for days when the mornings and evenings are cool and the days heat up while they are still new they look like they will launder nicely and the fabric is soft enough to wear over a teeshirt the oddest sizing i ve ever seen i normally wear a 2x i tried 3x and 4x in these while they re more than big enough around it seems like they were made for someone under 5 foot tall i m 5 10 and these barely make it to my belly button the hood is child sized and the sleeves only come down to mid forearm this pullover hoodie is worth every penny i have 4 of them that i wear when running in cold weather the material is comfortable durable and most importantly helps keep me warm there s not a better product out there for this price i highly recommend im very disappointed in the quality of the hoodies now i ve always purchased this exact one and same size and i noticed last year and this year when i received the hoodies that the band that goes around the area that wraps around your hips or lower waist isn t snug anymore it fits loose and looks as if it was stretched out i tried for two years in a row and the same issue so clearly you guys changed something and unless it changes back i won t be ordering anymore ordered the same size as other hanes hoodies purchased and these were smaller for the size and not as soft really disappointed since i bought three ordered size s i am 5 7 and usually wear mediums but this fits perfect super warm and great color not too bulky the hood wont lay flat if you want to tie the hood strings however the color is vibrant red and did not leak or anything when i washed it the comfortblend hoodie is both economical and comfortable i m a plus sized woman but i usually order from the men s hoodies because i find they have more room i appreciate the color choices and fit the don t fray or gather the piling very easily easy to wash and maintain that doesn t mean go digging ditches wearing them or anything but regular day to day wear is fine warm enough on a chilly day but also breathable without making you feel like you need to peel layers,men's clothing,0

125,Fruit of the loom SUPER VALUE 2 Pack Men's & Big Men's Waffle Thermal Underwear Crew,12.99,4.4,735.0,great for ladies too good basic thermal a good looking thermal baselayer shirt great for cool and very cold weather wonderful thermal underwear shirt great shirt comfortable thermal warm nice thermal shirt to keep you warm nice thermal top this is a nice shirt son is happy great for light layering great for a season fruit of the loom men s thermal crew shirt just the right fit warm and cozy keeps me warm dry and comfortable cool comfort,i usually wear a medium in t shirts so i got this top in a men s medium i am very satisfied with the fit construction comfort everything of this shirt it s very comfy and very warm lol i really like the look too i will get a ton of wear out of this because i stay freezing and it s stylish it seems to wear and hold up well over time this top lives up to its promises so i recommend it the fit is perfect on my husband it fits the same as other fotl clothing the material could be softer but i think after a few washes it will soften up the length is perfect not too long it is slim at the waist so it reduces bulk of worn under other clothing it is a good basic thermal shirt that will get many uses this winter the selling point of this shirt is that it s a henley the three button front makes it a presentable baselayer and not another ugly generic undershirt you want to keep hidden the grey coloring is light and the not typical dark grey the shirt is made up of 54 percent cotton and 46 percent that combines to make a soft and comfortable wear see attached photo of label right now here in florida it s the middle of summer so it s impossible for me to accurately say if this ll keep you warm in the middle of an arctic winter instead i can say this shirt is comfortable stylish and cool enough to be worn indoors thank you air conditioning during the warm summer florida months my only complaint would be that it has a generous cut i received a size large my normal size yet it fits loosely if used as a baselayer it should have a tighter fit so perhaps consider this when ordering this is my review of the fruit of the loom men s classic waffle thermal henley shirt i usually wear these shirts during the winter months under another shirt this time of year i will wear it as my only shirt because they look very nice they are completely warm to wear as a only shirt when the weather starts to get cool and can handle the very cold weather under another shirt and coat when real winter sets in fruit of the loom men s classic are always a great quality material and fit nicely one thing about thermal clothing you want it to fit well the quality of fruit of the loom has always been good and they continue to hold up while other makers of thermal clothing are starting to be less good in their final made quality the sleeves fit nice and are the correct length and the buttons do not pop off after a couple of washes i have the grey but have purchased the black and dark blue previously they all have maintained their quality and color appearance over the years just a nice addition to your causal wear and a get addition to your layer when the weather is freezing outside would recommend this shirt fruit of the loom thermal undershirt this is really nice it s lightweight but will feel really warm when you have it on under your shirt for those of us that have inner thermometers that don t work properly so we are often cold this will work great it will also work wonderfully for those that work outside are hunters or are outside alot the fabric is 65 polyester and 35 cotton so it will wear well wash well dry well and keep you from being wet from sweat they are also tagless so you won t have the constant itching or poking from a tag something it does say about laundering it you are not to use fabric softener on it fabric softeners can impede the benefits of some types of fabrics and garments canceling out the feature of some things about which you specifically bought the product for so always make sure to read the laundering instructions on anything you buy they aren t always the same this is a great shirt to wear under your clothes i guess you can wear just a a regular shirt also the shirt is made of nice material had a bit of a give to it love the waffle pattern in the shirt material is soft and held up great during the first wash color didn t seem to wash out i found no flaws in the material or stitching would purchase again it s a nice comfortable warm shirt thermal is comfortable but it is thin material not sure how long it will last but as of now a few uses it keeps me warm around the house and serves well as an extra layer when stepping outside not thick enough to use by itself outside but sure does it s job as an extra layer for warmth definitely would recommend as a undershirt during the wintertime and to walk around the house i received this fruit of the loom mens soft waffle baselayer crew neck top thermal for men from the walmart spark reviewer program to use and review these are soft and tag less no itchy feel they are warm when out in the cold and cool inside you dont sweat much in them and the moisture wicking material dries quick they also have odor control in them its still summer in the valley where i live but i was recently backpacking in the high cascades of washington state and it got down right cold at night this thermal shirt kept me warm i did not need it while hiking i like this fruit of the loom thermal shirt thank you for reading this review this is a fruit of the loom thermal shirt the color is black i thought the shirt to be a bit thin i think a heavier shirt would be better i weigh about 165 pounds and the shirt fit ok but a bit snug i would prefer a bit larger for a medium see the photo for an idea of the fit i received this shirt in august and i can say it will probably keep you warm in the winter after having it on for a few minutes i started to become uncomfortably warm with a normal tee shirt on i did not feel warm so the thermal part seems to be effective the snug fit might be a plus since you will probably wear this under another shirt in the winter i think this will be useful when the temperatures are in the single digits or teens and i need to go outside to shovel snow unless you are a thin build you will probably opt for the large size winter is a ways off but i will certainly pull this out of the closet for that unfortunate event when it snows and i have to shovel it off the sidewalks it ripped the second day of using them this is a nice thermal just like you d expect with the name fruit of the loom nice snug fit will surely help keep the body heat in on a cold day when you have to be outside you can expect to get a few good years out of it before it stretches and loses it regular fit these do run a little small in sizing as compared to other clothing i always get 1 size bigger because i ve known these to shrink a little after a few washes just my experience the color stays fast for years just size is the only thing that changed as it wears shrinkage i give it a 4 of 5 only for the fact they run small in size this is a nice shirt the quality and fabric it s not cheaply made my son came home and i gave it to him to where he normally doesn t wear stuff like this and i had to ask them i don t know how many times to try it on to see if it fit him and he finally tried it on and he didn t take it off until the next morning he liked that it was very light weight but heavy in a way to say didn t make him hot and he even recommended that he wears it underneath a short sleeve shirt whenever the weather gets cooler so overall he likes the shirt i received fruit of the loom men s soft waffle waffle baselayer crew neck top thermal underwear for men and my 15 year old likes it he normally wears a large but received the medium and it fits just fine he actually put it over another shirt and it stretches without effort it s made from 65 polyester and 35 cotton perfect shirt for layering when the cold weather is upon us i work in a freezer so i like to layer something under my t shirts at times so that i don t have to put on my heavy coat for short durations i am a woman and prefer men s sizing on this type of item gives longer bit at waist and arms which i need this shirt is thin but keeps me warm while i am running around i do not think that this would be great for sitting in cold temperatures for hunting maybe as a base layer not as a main outer piece the sleeves are generous and do not ride up my arms at all fabric is thin and soft very comfortable i did find a slight bit of shrinking in the wash but not a huge amount i do recommend this for either gender it is a staple layering piece anyone who works outdoors in winter or all year in cold environments this thermal is ideal in that it is both effective and thin i have not worn it in extreme temperatures yet but i have been able to wear it by itself and kept warm in cold situations it fits tight but thermals should be tight even so the arms are plenty long this is a review of the fruit of the loom men s thermal crew shirt things wrong was the size is not accurate it didn t come close to fitting me although that was my size it barely fit my youngest daughter who wears medium so she gave the input on this item she said it just barely fits me and it s really long it s also really thin and see through also it doesn t feel very warm or good for winter it s also quite itchy so with all these issues i would not recommend this item i am writing this review on the fruit of the loom men s soft waffle waffle base layer crew neck top thermal underwear for men i really like this shirt it is very soft and comfortable it has all the style qualities i look for in a thermal top also it is something i will definitely buy more of i will be buying the bottoms that go with these also fruit of the loom makes high quality thermal underwear for men i highly recommend this over other brands i have several of these thermal under shirts and really enjoy the comfort and warmth they provide this fruit of the loom shirt is relatively thin you can see through it but it is still comfortable and warm i like that you don t feel like you are wearing something heavy i will get a lot of use out of this later this year as things cool off this review is for the men s fruit of the loom soft waffle baselayer crew neck thermal top underwear i go camping about 120 days a year especially in the winter season i like cold camping because i just layer up and down as needed to regulate my temperature this fruit of the loom crew neck baselayer thermal top is perfect i wear a 100 polyester t shirt then this thermal top as my next layer of defense to fight the cold while keeping me warm and protecting me with its waffle knit fabric the material feels good on my skin and is made of 65 polyester and 35 cotton this thermal top is tagless however the label is stamped into material and says do not use fabric softener this thermal top really does feel good to wear with added features like the wrists area has ribbed cuffs which help keep heat in the seams are flatlock meaning that are not sticking up and rubbing on skin which can create chafing as for working around the campsite i begin sweating a little wearing other types of garments this is where this thermal top has great performance and design it wicks away moisture by having moisture wicking technology keeping me dryer another great feature of the design having intellifresh odor control capabilities keeping me odor free for a thermal top to have this many features to keep me warm dry comfortable chafless and odor free is great technology for the outdoors the men s fruit of the loom soft waffle baselayer crew neck thermal top is a permanent piece of clothing gear for me to experience the great outdoors i will be purchasing 5 more to add to my winter camping gear and i will also be purchasing the matching bottoms i give it 2 thumbs up anyone who works or plays outside in cold weather knows the importance of dressing in layers what used to be called longjohns are now soft waffle crew neck baselayer thermal underwear layered over a t shirt and under a sweatshirt or flannel you have a great start for keeping warm this winter also stylish enough to wear as a long sleeve top indoors especially the black or blue versions fruit of the loom has a winner here with an accessory list that reads like a new car you ll be working or lounging in total comfort how about dual defense moisture wicking fabric to keep you dry and comfortable intellifresh odor control to cut down on objectional you know smells a tag free soft waffle fabric design with ribbed cuffs to stay in place machine washable and reasonably priced in several colors i ll be wearing mine often this fall and winter,men's clothing,0

163,"Thermajohn Men Long Sleeve Baselayer Cool Dry Compression T-Shirt for Athletic Workout and Running (XXXX-Large, Raglan - Navy)",19.99,4.7,92.0,cool comfortable with a great fit great for running in cold weather thin form fitting light weight comfortable lightweight shirt looks good on me light and well fitting good long sleve dri fit good compression shirt smooth snug fit great for my wife nice quality thermajohn she s a wicker great for wearing underneath clothing great shirt to use during 50f to 65f range comfortable and well made thermajohn men long sleeve baselayer cool dry comp nice material great shirt with one caveat great fit and very comfortable comfortable looks like i lost a couple of lbs amazing comfort and feel,i have a couple of off brand compression type shirts and this thermajohn model is definitely a large step up from them the material has a high quality feel and the stitching is solid and well reinforced through out the shirt i was able to wear it on a jog around my neighborhood and found that the material has a nice wicking cooling effect even with the long sleeve design in 80 degree weather it keeps the sun off my arms so i don t have to use as much sunscreen just to go out for a run the thing that i like most about the shirt is that the compression material offers just the right amount of support not like other compression type shirts that i have tried and felt like i had to struggle to even breathe if you are in need of a high quality compression shirt this would be a great choice i wore this out the other day in 50 degree weather so a bit chilly and just had on a t shirt over it this thing kept me pretty warm i also wore it out for a few hours just sitting on the porch in chilly weather around 55 degrees and it kept me very comfortable it seems to do well against wind chill too although i haven t tested that out comprehensively yet definitely a useful shirt to have for runners who have to run in cold weather this is a very thin form fitting shirt it is a 87 polyester and 13 elastic jersey blend if you have a very athletic shape and form this is a very fashionable shirt that will flaunt yourself to the world if not it is an excellent undershirt for when you know you are going to sweat or need a little something extra to wear if you are an athlete think baseball this is a great warm up shirt to wear under your jersey or even to wear it on a bike ride i could see it being worn as an undershirt for basketball too it really does keep moisture sweat off your skin i also like that it so thin you don t feel like you are wearing anything at all very light i am a man and don t wear leggings but it is just like ladies leggings that are of the same fabric it has great ventilation as described on the packaging i can t say it is truly anti odor because body odor is body odor when you are active this is a machine wash on cold and tumble dry on low fabric since there is elastic in this you may even want to hang to dry i know it will wrinkle but it will save the elastic in the long run i like it this shirt is form fitting but because it is also very stretchy and lightweight i find it very comfortable to wear the color i ordered was navy and i expected it to be a darker color blue than it is but it is still a blue color that i like it has wide gray colored stitching that defines the raglan sleeves and the midsection of the shirt the stitching is generally well done except on the shirt i received there is an inch of turquoise colored thread over stitched on the grey thread which looks a little odd but should not negatively affect the wearability or longevity of the shirt although i feel it should have been caught by quality control before packaging i feel i will get a lot of use out of this shirt especially while exercising i will be able to sweat but because of the wicking element of the material i should always feel dry i could also wear this shirt as a base shirt under my clothes in cold weather i also see myself using this shirt as a rash guard in the ocean since it has such a nice snug fit it should keep me from getting sunburned without having to wear a looser regular t shirt this thermajohn long sleeve athletic t shirt came perfectly fitted to my body not too tight and not too loose soft cozy and thin it may just be the most comfortable long sleeve shirt i have ever worn looks great and fits even better it will bring out your body features so if you have a big chest it will show also that applies to a not so flat stomach as well i washed this twice since i received it and it has held up pretty well no fading bleeding or shrinkage i plan on buying a few more to stock up with for casual wear and some for working out in great for jogging working out or just lounging around the house i like that this shirt is very light and very soft i got it for use as a workout shirt so i went one size larger because i don t like clingy shirts if i were to buy this shirt for the compression factor i would have gone 2 sizes smaller i like the length it doesn t rise past my waist when i raise my arms fully and the armpit area has plenty of room as well overall it s a good quality and well designed workout shirt i didnt expect the great quality of this long sleve dri fit i like the fabric though the size is small for me or im not that fit but it feels comfortable i work nights in the hospital as a nurse and wear this twice already with my scrubs on it gives me enough warm and no need for me to wear jacket i would highly recommend this it is affordable and good quality this compression shirt is just what i was looking for it fits snug enough to where it s not too tight but also tight enough to be comfortable i use this for early morning running on the weekends to where it s cool so this shirt keeps me warm enough but not where it s uncomfortably hot i have lost a lot of weight so all the loose skin stays in place when i m running which makes it easier for me to run i would recommend this compression shirt to anyone that is looking for a compression type fit i will be buying more shirts for the rest of the week when i work out didn t have my size in this dry compression t shirt was about to pass it up when i realized the extra small shirt available would fit my wife who at 5 ft tall and 95 pounds would be considered petite we found the shirt to be well made very smooth and flexible we are not in the cold season but kind of cool when she put it on and said it fit well didn t bind and was comfortable it also remained cool longer then expected which in cold weather isn t that great she wore it all morning including some weed pulling outside in the sun her conclusion was that is would be alright underneath another garment in the winter but not by itself the arm length and shoulder fit were very good the length was more than expected see photos but not detrimental after the initial washing in seemed to dry well and did not require any touch up with the iron being in our 80 s jogging out in the hot sun was not our routine so we are unable to comment on the athletic capabilities but she commented she would not be wearing a long sleeve dark colored tight fitting shirt in any event all in all the shirt was found to be comfortable and would recommend if the price wasn t too high ok a few things went wrong here i believe i ordered a men s small obviously there was some sort of error with review saying the xxxxl i opened the package and it was a size small which would have been great if not for the fact it was a women s small you could tell by the cut and the logo was a female ok now for the good my wife says she loves it nice compression material that is not itchy after a half hour of wearing form fitting as expected and the perfect length not showing too much but not long for her height of 5 3 it falls right at the waist i wonder what i got to do to get the correct size for me taking a picture of the logo it says thermajane not thermajohn this shirt gets 5 stars for material and style great wicking action while running you can feel the cooling action as your pores open up and sweat glands start to heat up the dark blue color did not show water stains the sizing seems to be one size bigger so my xs extra small size seems to be a s small the 87 polyester seems to be sufficiently breathable and the 13 lycra trademarked is called elastic jersey is very stretchable 4 way stretching and conforms to your shape be prepared to get a lot if head turns head and show off with your highlighted those well defined muscles curves raglan fit made in china the stitching on this long sleeve compression shirt couldn t be better all of the materials used are good quality it has a tight fit as it should and locks in you body heat but unlike thermal it also helps keep you cool when you work up a sweat because it has a tight fit there is no bulk when wearing this underneath other clothing and it is very comfortable i went this long sleeve shirt to use with biking on days when the temperature is in between 50f to 65f degrees not warm enough for short sleeves but not cold enough for more winter like performance clothing this shirt fits that need perfectly i with the navy color which works great on sunny days you get the heat of the sun from the darker cooler but the shirt has great breath ability so you don t feel over heated during my work out unlike other performance shirts i ve used this one does a great job of pulling sweat away from you skin so it helps you feel more comfortable in exercising initially i was concerned being 6 2 as i normally take xlt and the shirt is only offered as xl generally i ve run into problems with performance clothing being woefully undersized or completely wrong in sizing their shirts from s to xxl thankfully that is not the case and the shirt i got as an xl is plenty long enough in tail and sleeves for me at 6 2 and whether you take xl or xlt i think this size on this shirt is correct and works for by regular and tall size needs i m guessing other sizes are correct as well in the past i would have given the shirt 5 stars but i think after what has happen in 2020 consumers are much more concerned with where things are manufactured of which i am once such consumer and i ll leave it at that i m impressed by this thermajohn compression t shirt i have other name brand compression shirts and this one ranks right up there in terms of quality and construction the material is smooth and feels comfortable during workouts i especially like the raglan sleeves since i m usually bothered by stitching over my shoulders i chose a size large and it fits quite nicely with just about as much tightness as in the model and with enough snugness to keep things from chaffing i m a thin 6 foot tall 150 pounds and i wear a 42r suit jacket i m not a body builder and prefer long sleeve for cycling and lighter colors for visibility the light steel grey is nice and generic enough to blend in with a variety of clothing i ll be purchasing another in slate color now that i know how nice these are i got the thermajohn men long sleep base layer cool dry compression t shirt for athletic workout and running to try out since i enjoy going out on hikes camping and enjoying the outdoors my wife said too bad it didn t come with a 6pack for the shapewear part which is supposed to make me look lean and mean there are different color options but i went with a charcoal gray looking color because it can go with pretty much anything the shirt wicked away the sweat from my day enjoying the outdoors and was soft and comfortable to wear for long day out of the house i would recommend this for those working out in the gym any sport that makes you break a sweat or even work it is stylish and comfortable and depending on the work you do you may need a comfortable shirt to wick away your sweat i got the long sleeve one but love it so much i am planning to get the t shirt option as well for the summer with so many options i would mind have a few options ready for me to use without having to wait for them to be laundered for the next wear i have multiple other brands of thermal layers and i like this one even better than the namebrand one that most people think of when they think about thermal layers the material was soft flexible and definitely helped keep me warm it fit well i recommend using their size chart before you buy because i am in between a small and a medium for normal clothes but the small thermajohn fit me perfectly in my pictures there is a square crease around the logo on the chest but it s just from the packaging not a defect overall this is now my favorite thermal layer out of all of the brands i have tried this is a great shirt it s well made the materials and workmanship are very good and it s very comfortable i just wore it for a few hours in the hot florida sun doing some hard yard work i am not sweaty at all this is very unusual for me the shirt wicked away an impressive amount of moisture i am not hot apparently the ventilation technology works very well also i do not smell at all so the anti odor technology works very well the only thing that i want to warn you about is the sizing i wear medium size cloths and that is the size that i ordered i do not feel much compression with this shirt because i believe it is too large for me there is a slight snugness around my neck but otherwize it s rather loose if you check the sizing chart which i did not have when i ordered i see that i should have ordered the x small for a 32 inch waist what that s just crazy so it s a great shirt but order carefully i have often found that compression shirts are hit and miss when it comes to correct sizing many are made overseas and only fit teenie tiny people yet are marked with american sizing i was skeptical when ordering this thermajohn men s long sleeve compression t shirt as i looked up the brand and found that it was made in china however when i received this shirt i was more than pleasantly amazed the thermajohn shirt is well made has four way stretch that allows for freedom of movement no matter the activity it is definitely moisture wicking material since i am a heavy sweater when it comes to athletics and the shirt seemed to pull the moisture away from my skin and allowed my skin to stay fairly dry and cool i ordered a size larger than i generally wear in sweats and athletic clothing because i wanted a fairly tight fit yet not one that strangled my body uncomfortably i was very pleased with the size that i ordered as there is a snugness to the shirt yet allows my blood to keep pumping i found one stitching defect in the shirt where it appears one spool of thread ran out and a new one was started it appears that this was caught at the factory and corrected yet left blue stitching instead of the grey yet that s being really picky overall the quality of the product is excellent and well worth the package marked 39 99 price it appears to be long lasting and well manufactured great shirt comfortable soft and keep cool feeling when running my neighbors asked me if i lose weight recently actually it is this thermajohn t shirt makes me looks like a bit thinner but i am glad they thought so this thermajohn men long sleeve baselayer cool dry compression t shirt is very comfortable now is spring time and i run every day with this t shirt for about a week i am living in a walking community and during this covid 19 crisis the street is almost empty i run on sidewalks sometime on the road during first half of running as outside temperature is around 50s this thermajohn t shirt keeps me warm even in windy days or some with some drizzle i still feel very comfortable to run with thermajohn long sleeve t shirt after warm up period if i choose a hilly route that day maybe just after 10 minutes of running i already begin sweating this thermajohn long sleeve t shirt is very breathable not sticky to my skin it keeps my skin the dry feeling for most of the time it is good for gym too if you like long sleeve for me i prefer short sleeve t shirt for gym overall it is a good t shirt for running jogging and hiking the product is packaged so as to be displayed as a peg item from a worker perspective if these items were grouped in threes it would be much easier and faster to display and maybe that is the case i have never owned nor have i purchased any product such as this thermajohn long sleeve shirt and i was not knowledgeable about this item because i purchase cotton workout equipment i went to the website to do some research and better understand this item i really like and appreciate how easy it was to open the packaging to get to the product it sure was nice not to struggle or find a scissors thank you very thoughtful like all products which i have never worn i always wash the item i read the instructions and i did not encounter any problems whether with the washing or drying and the product never had a problem either this shirt is a very interesting product i have never owned any garment that feels great and from my perspective it is very easy for me to forget that i am wearing this shirt and at times i have to make a conscious effort and remind myself that i am wearing this shirt and this shirt has such a wonderful feel nothing like i have experienced before all i can compare this shirt to is a cotton shirt and this shirt feels so much nicer than cotton it is easy to fall asleep in this shirt and really not realizing that i am wearing the shirt i have fallen asleep in other clothes many different times before and when i awoke i really wish that i hadn t very nice job with this garment as far as fit and feel this shirt is very comfortable in temperatures well above 80 degrees sure do have all the bases covered bravo and thank you job well done,men's clothing,1

180,ORORO Men's Heated Fleece Jacket Full Zip with Battery Pack,119.99,0.0,32.0,can t believe how warm it is topnotch so far five stars going to love it a phenomenal jacket excellent product worn october 31 2020 soft cuddly and warm but runs a little small a great purchase works great buy this you won t regret it this is great jacket,i ordered this jacket 2 weeks ago and it s warm without the heat on i m very happy with this jacket i just ordered a second battery and two pairs of socks thanks ororo veery stylish and very warm perfect for the northern wisconsin weather was bought for wearing under a winter coat when plowing snow wife says to nice for that i absolutely love my heated fleece jacket the quality is top notch i actually get excited every time i get to put it on because it works and does what it promises to do live in michigan always cold spring winter and fall not anymore fleece jacket everything and more as advertised is know my go to jacket to stay toasty even taking to florida on vacation thanks for creating awesome product absolutely adore this jacket the fabric is soft pillowy and feels like i m wrapped in a blanket a perfect holiday treat this is well worth the money you would spend with out the heating element add the heating element and its way beyond a good value these jackets are awesome glad i bought three of them one for my wife one for myself and one for my coworker i just got this and tried it out when outside during halloween with the kids and it worked well and the quality surprised me definitely well made but one thing that i wished is that it would stay on the high setting until adjusted by me and not over a certain amount of time adjusting down a level automatically not a big deal as you can just adjust it back to the high heat setting manually i bought this originally because i wanted something to keep me warmer when play golf during the fall months and the position of the battery pocket is more on the back left hip area which doesn t impede my golf swing in all i am impressed with the quality and would recommend i haven t bought any other competing brands like volt or other so i can t attest to how they compare good or bad very stylish battery doesn t last as long as expected but still effective since i ordered second battery wish there was an inside pocket i m a lady but i purchased this for myself based on the reviews and what i was looking for i already own a hoodie and love it so i knew i would be happy with the men s fleece the color is fantastic definitely unisex and the feel is very soft and it feels cuddly it is heavier than i thought which is a great thing it isn t a thin fleece i haven t worn it yet as i just opened it the only suggestion i would make is to order a size up i would normally order a men s large but after owning the hoodie i was almost certain the fleece would run small too i ordered an xl and was very happy that i did i could have ordered the xxl and had a little extra room without it being too big i can t wait to put it to good use works great long lasting and looks nice the battery is heavy and it makes you feel a little off balance because it sits on your left side but i understand why it needs to sit there it could be bothersome sometimes especially if trying to lay down the heat is awesome but i do wish there was a spot that heats up on the lower back easy to use and love the fact that you can control the temp easily with just pressing a button the color of grey is darker in person than on the picture it is more of a charcoal grey i have nerve pain which gets worse in the winter time and this helps immensely great product i get asked about it all the time n nfor sizing i am a woman 142lb 34b 29 waist and a men s small jacket fit me the very bottom of it is a little snug but i would recommend to size these products to be very fitted to your body so you can really feel the warmth coming from it this fleece jacket fits well is stylish and the battery system is easy to charge and operate the jacket is warm and comfortable even without employing the heating system yet the warmth of the heating pads in strategic areas make it even more exquisite i bought this because i ve previously used an ororo heated vest and have loved it the past year two of my family members have one now as well after seeing and wearing mine my sister has pots disease and is cold all the time she got heated clothes from ororo and it s made a big difference for her i wear mine at work and started a tend with my coworkers i also like to wear the heated gear under my coat and it keeps me really warm especially good for hunting or shoveling the driveway the red setting warms you up when cold the white and blue settings maintain your warmth i ve tried other heated clothing brands and they never got as warm lasted as long or was as good of quality as ororo i love their products and would highly recommend them to anyone bought it for a light liner i wore it today in mild freezing weather low was comfortable while working in the morning while the fleece itself was fine later on was able to stay mobile and not hung up from layering with it under a hoody all day nice battery with extra options my husband loves this jacket comfortable enough to wear inside when there s a chill comfortable with or without the heat on but great with heat very high

187,Boulder Creek by KingSize Men's Big & Tall  Denim Overalls,36.34,0.0,101.0,comfortable work clothes that hold up to real work overalls comfortable well made with all the pockets great fishing outfit great to fish in hardware is bad won t stay up sturdy fabric lousy hardware design flaw in buckles bummet need stronger clasps great coverhauls well received gift fast and accurate order and recieved quicker then was told it takes cheap disappointed comfortable overalls overalls bibs life,i have been buying bibs from this company for years some colors are made differently than others are are not the same material or comfort level the stone washed bibs are the best they have also upgraded the fasteners on the straps also which was my biggest complaint these seem to be better made but time will tell my husband loves them he says they are very comfortable i wasn t sure how a big man would look in overalls but they are quite complimentary this is why we shop king size direct for all his clothing needs having been raised in traditional overalls i was a little nervous sending off for these would they be quality would they fit would they have all the pockets yes yes and yes they even have the traditional watch pocket for the old time pocket watch which i like to wear the material is good solid denim and they didn t shrink when washed the only problems i could find was first they didn t have the hole for the watch chain i use the button hole for one of the bib pockets and i think there should be one more hole for the pencil if the pencil is new the holes that are there are too short these are very minor and i am very pleased these are great for working around the shop or yard i ll be buying more very comfortable any kind of activity personality i do power woodcarving and love working in them and the fit to you they offer has been right on i wear a 42 35 pant and kingsize recommended 44 35 which turned out to be a perfect fit thank you love your clothes and special offer emails very comfortable and great to fish in with all the extra pockets fit was spot on i can t move the slide on the fit scale true to size i ordered these in a large size 56 30 the buckles came apart after a few washes then i notified customer service to try and get just a replacement buckle to do my own repair i was told i would have to return them within the 90 day window to get a replacement i did not want a replacement only a buckle i would only have the same problem again with a new pair i will not purchase these again for that very reason i man that size need a heavier buckle great overalls lousy fasteners no matter what i do the straps keep coming unfastened worst pair of bibs i ve ever owned and i ve owned many the fabric is durable and the sizing is accurate my husband says they fit comfortably however the buckles for fastening the straps are of very poor quality the covers on the ends of the buckles are brittle and break off in the washing machine resulting in the buckles falling off of the garments and no longer being able to fasten very comfortable in the fit seem to be durable however the clasp buckle has a design flaw that renders the overalls unusable unless they are replaced buckles are a 2 piece design that tends to come apart in washing machine and or dryer replacing the buckles is a problem because finding heavy duty buckles for overalls is proving to be a challenge and the company does not sell replacement buckles bibs ripped at seam first time i worked in them bummer good fit good price but one of the clasps broke easy to wear and look great i bought this as a gift for a family member who told me it fit great and was more comfortable than his usual brand he said he will buy this item in the future fast ordering fast shipping faster then quoted crooked seams buckle wire broke snapped in dryer only wore about 6 times not hemmed right one not at all love the coveralls buapt the fasteners are terrible they keep falling apart unfastening very comfortable and stylish all in one i recommend this to all shoppers i have 2 pair i like them very much comfortable hte more you wear them more comfortable they are last longer and better fit,men's clothing,0

shocked at this product it s very impressive for the price seriously this is comparable to a 100 down jacket it s filled with 90 down 10 feathers so no synthetic fill this makes it very lightweight and very packable it comes with a little stuff sack to pack it into and the 700 fill down lofts up nicely to provide a good amount of insulation for such a light jacket n ni m a big guy usually wear a xxxl size t shirt and the xxl jacket fits me almost perfectly i can certainly wear it comfortably without noticing that it s technically a size too small for me n nsuper stoked about this jacket glad i purchased this coat saved my bacon when i realized my new quilt doesn t have a draw string around the shoulders packs super small too comes with its own stuff sack but i fit it in a smaller one i went with the sky blue because it was 10 cheaper i d much rather be warm than fashionable when a hiking it was a little bit snug but not terribly uncomfortable i feel very satisficed of the coat warm light and high quality material work very well form autumn to winter time i will definitely buy again 5 stars when i first got it i thought it wasn t going to be warm enough but i was very warm not warm enough for sustained single digit temps but for the majority of the winter it was ma daily coat was that is till someone walked off with it so evidently at least one other person agrees with me oh well once it s back in stock i ll be getting a placement this might be my favorite kid s coat ever it s thin and not bulky at all but just as warm as a thicker coat my son loves it highly recommend this one i was a bit confused by some of the reviews claiming this jacket runs small i normally wear size 42 dress shirts and depending on particular jacket can fall in the l or xl size to be on the safe side i ordered both sizes large fits well if a bit tight if this is to be your second layer on top of a t shirt or light shirt large is the right size if this is to be your third layer on top of a sweater or hoodie then you may want to go for an xl in my case i kept the l and returned the xl bought this for my son to take on a backpacking trip at philmont new mexico we needed something packable light and warm this fit the bill perfect we placed it in a small compression sack and packed it down to nothing he said it was very warm and worked perfectly he plans on using it during the year he really likes the way it looks ordering was very easy and shipping was very fast this is easily my favorite jacket it is super light and very warm when cold out even if it is a little warm out you don t bake in the jacket and you never feel the wind i would definitely buy another jacket from them in the future great product at a great price for the price this jacket works well warm surprisingly light full size zipper as opposed to the fragile small zipper on expensive options like patagonia childish and stupid brand name just sayin more importantly the arm openings at the armpit is small and tight not a deal breaker but it be a major problem if hiking moving all day overall great jacket especially for the price down jacket was exactly as shown i am glad i ordered a size larger than i usually use looking forward to seeing how it performs in cold weather lightweight stuffs into bag easily pockets do no keep hands too warm inside pockets not sewn closed i love things that can be retracted or shrunken down to a easy carry along size such as multi tools etc this down warmy compatible stuffed in a bag coat jacket is so easy to hide anywhere you might need it car luggage etc it could save your life or at least your comfort great quality for the price its quite warm other reviews say it runs small but i wear a size large jacket and this size large had room to spare i have no middle aged spread and sleeves are nice and long and i m a lanky guy recommended i bought this for my son as he needed a light weight warm winter layer it is perfect for the purpose and the bright blue around the collar gives it a little more zip than the standard puffer coat the only reason that i did not give it five stars is that it has a very boxy fit so that it fits well in the shoulders but is kind of loose at the weight i like everything about this jacket i bought the green purple and its color is as shown i got tricked into thinking they ran small so i ordered the next larger size but had to return it for the advertised size i am 73 in charlotte nc weighing 220 at 6 feet and it is perfect this is a packable jacket so if you live in minnesota this would be good in addition to a heavy coat the jacket is truly a down jacket with 10 feathers with a sample enclosed as opposed to some other high price down advertised jackets that are polyester filled you would think i work for the company but no i am retired and need to find value and quality in my purchases i would definitely purchase this again preface this is the first down jacket i have ever purchased but i do own a down sleeping bag i was interested in trying out a down jacket but did not want to spend upwards of 200 for one until i had a chance to try one out i decided to purchase this jacket instead of borrow a more expensive one from friends at first a had some reservations i am 6 foot tall and weigh 280 pounds i was worried that the xxl would be too small for me also i would have preferred a hooded jacket and would have gladly spent 50 instead of 30 for a hooded model the color of the jacket was exactly as advertised and xxl fit me well it is a little snug but i like the feeling of snug from this jacket the outer shell is very lightweight and does a good job of repelling rain light rain drops ball up and roll down the material easily while one should not where a down jacket in the rain it is good to see that it can repel water and give one the opportunity to take it off before the outer material soaks through the inner material does a very good job of insulating i can feel the warmth starting to build moments after zipping the jacket up the zippers work very well both on the pockets and the main zipper they run smooth and do not catch on the material the only negative thing i can say about the zipper is that my beard would catch on it if the zipper is not zipped all the way up but that is a very minor problem i am most impressed with how the jacket handles the wind once zipped up the jacket feels like a cocoon of warm air surrounding your torso while the wind does blow against the jacket it doesn t really pierce through it i can feel the temperature inside the jacket drop slightly but i do not feel the wind against my skin i wore the jacket for several afternoons while i did bus duty at my middle school it did a great job keeping me warm the very first day i wore it i got hit with some bird crap on the right shoulder i spot cleaned the shoulder with some paper towel and a water the stain came off readily if they sell a hooded model i will definitely buy another from this brand i bought this xxl jacket for outer layer purposely oversized to wear a sweater and vest under perfect only disappointment is inside pockets are not sewn at the bottom a good surprise the color green is darker i also purchased a xl aqua blue thank you jim i really like puffer jackets and have bought several different makes over the last several years i use them in place of sweaters because of their warmth and light weight but the rokka rolla is the best i ve purchased so far good quality low price good fit and as you d expect light weight and provides excellent warmth and i love the blue color my son received this jacket today he s 5 10 160lbs a medium fit him perfectly he says its very lightweight soft and traps heat very well hes going to use it hiking and it gets 5 stars for now we will update you on how it stood the test in the mountains this jacket arrived today and it exceeds my expectations many of the reviews i read before buying it warned of poor sizing workmanship and backward zippers i must be lucky because the jacket seems like a great buy the main zipper is on the correct size for a man the arms on my xl size are a perfect length i wear a 35 sleeve in dress shirts and are finished with a nice band for the wrist area the jacket is super light but reasonably fluffy i bought it to wear beneath a shell parka for downhill skiing the malibu blue color is really pleasant and the xl size was perfect for me 6 4 tall 200 lbs the stitching seems ok although although time will tell if it holds up on day one it looks fine one oddity inside the jacket there appears to be two side pockets interestingly if you put your hand all the way down these pockets your hands go right through the pockets to air that is the bottom horizontal seam of each pocket is not sewn shut maybe they re not supposed to be pockets but they sure look like inside pockets overall i m thrilled at the sizing appearance and cost of this garment it will not compete with a name brand high end puffer jacket made by a high end outdoor clothing co but for the amz price it s a no brainer for someone looking for reasonably good jacket at a bargain price lucky me good fit decent overall quality and great value not going to lie this is by far the best purchase i have made in 2020 this puffer jacket is really lightweight so it is perfect for everyday wear and extreme activities that jacket is very soft and breathable so that means you re able to layer it with hoodies shirts underneath comfortably durability wise i only had this for a couple weeks but i wore it snowboarding a couple times and it held up perfectly fine no scratch or rips at all which was to my amazement i love this jacket why 1 for 75 of our winter in utah it is plenty warm enough on its own when it hits 25 f or less i use it as a liner jacket under my artic quality down eddy bauer heavy duty down jacket for blizzards 2 it looks great 3 has a nifty stuff bag 4 very light 5 easy to wash 6 very durable 7 zips up easy without getting caught 8 easy to put on and off one wish i wish it had a draw string at the waist other than that it is a great daily wear jacket that i truly love,men's clothing,0

i have ever owned lightweight but very very warm best jacket ever excellent quality and function awesome winter coat arm and torso length are perfect for a tall gentleman best winter coat for the price cozy and warm very warm and wind resistant jacket warm to 0 degrees f,i love the style zipper collar and deep pockets color and oversized hood keeps me warm in a cooler this jacket is my favorite it fits perfect is lightweight it is also very warm everything it perfect about it the large size fits me perfectly looks cool in the black great job on this jacket very nice warm jacket i love it is my everyday jacket it has been very cold on the mid atlantic region this winter wear this w short sleeve shirt and i m fine the rokka rolla men s water resistant hooded thickened insulated quilted puffer jacket is a hit great fit quality and price hey this was probably the best purchase for a jacket ever it s stylish and works in sub zero weather during my trip to alaska i wore it with thermals and a basic wool sweater in 16 degree temperatures with no issue when it reached 10 degrees i just wore the jacket with a t shirt coming from a florida boy i d say it got the job done having tried a couple options in a padded jacket this one most closely resembled the puffer style and temperature i was looking for construction seems sturdy and is very warm down to 20 degrees f wind is nearly undetectable as well and so far definitely seems water resistant would recommend great jacket for the price its been keeping warm in 30 to 40 degree temperatures i got the large and it has enough room to layer up with my thermals and hoodie underneath only problem i have is i only had it for 2 weeks and there are some small threads coming loose bought a medium to fit on my 5 3 135 lb 13yo as i figured ther would be some layering involved also i still have the nasty habit of sizing up for my kid which doesn t work as well when they get a little older i m realizing it s a little roomy we ve had a super mild winter catskill mtns ny so not much opportunity to be bundled up but there is something style wise i think my kid just isn t that into despite swearing all he wanted for a winter coat was a black puffy coats he s worn it a few times layered over a t shirt and hoodie it is waterproof and warm attested and it seems like it s going to hold up especially if it stays in the closet i ordered a medium for my bf he is 160 lbs and it was too big i hope the small fits him better he really liked the coat great coat i m always skeptical about online purchases sizing so many items come and you discover it s non us sizing not in this case i live in the south we don t really need coats i m visiting michigan for the holidays with my spouse this coat passed her you won t freeze to death test it s great looking it s thick it fits perfectly enough for a sweater or hoodie underneath it didn t smell funny it s very impressive i can t wait to wear it in the forecasted snow i bought this jacket for my son he needed something warm and this product does that this jacket is soft and warm and fluffy but not bulky i ordered him a medium and it is a little big but it s perfect because i m hoping he ll be able to fit it next year if not i ll be buying this jacket again i was shocked and pleasantantly surprised at how warm the coat is i live in northern utah where the mountains just to the north of us get 400 inches of snow a year and it gets very cold here i have always had a terrible time with the cold i typically wear at least three coats one vest and two other coats for the layered effect and i still freeze the previous users reviews had mentioned how warm this coat was when i got the coat it didn t look as warm as most of my coats i have had and i thought i would shiver again shockingly the coat is much warmer than any other coat i have ever worn it must have to do with the insulation today i took a walk in the weather that was around freezing and i thought for sure i would need another layer to keep me warm to my shock i was covered with sweat when i got back from the walk which i have never experienced with any other coat i have worn it has not gotten really cold here yet so i don t know how it will do when it gets really cold but i an say without any hesitation that for freezing type weather this coat is very warm and just amazing because it doesn t look that warm but it really is a well insulated coat very pleasantly surprised i m 5 2 and 170lbs and it s very hard to find something that fits good i went with a large and it s perfect size covers my butt but not to big perfect i loved the great reviews and got this jacket based off the great reviews i live in wisconsin where it can get very cold fast so i needed a good warm jacket when it arrived i was somewhat doubtful it was great material but didn t seem like it would keep me warm in 0 degree weather and before 0 temps but was i very happy to learn that this jacket is the warmest jacket i have ever had all big names brands can t compare to the warmth of this jacket very lightweight but very warm love the detail love the soft feel love the jacket would recommend to anyone hands down best jacket ever this is an exceptional bargain to get this level of quality at this price point this is the second coat i ve purchased from rokka rolla the first purchase was for myself once i realized how nice the quality is and how warm the coats are i decided it was gift worthy and gave one to my daughter for xmas super high quality product and company very functional and warm fit s exactly as expected 5 stars all the way f ing nailed it super trendy and fun coat keeps you nice and warm and perfect for the cold winters we have here in buffalo ny this one is more versatile and less bulky still gives that perfect puffer look but isn t too overwhelming to carry on your body i got great compliments on it too perfect if you re looking for something to keep you warm and stylish my husband needed a warm coat in a freezing environment he is very tall and difficult to buy for as not many coats fit his height this coat is exactly what he needs it fends off the chill and fits him perfectly a great coat at a reasonable price i was nervous about buying this coat and it not being warm enough or fitting wrong i was pleasantly surprised when i got the coat i like well fitting coats and i am an athletic build and 185 lbs the medium fit perfect it is warm and not too heavy overall this coat competes with others that are 3 times its price i got this for my bro cause he works outside everyday and he told me it gets really cold so i got him this jacket and he really loves it he said it is really comfortable and warm we live in fl so we don t do too good in this cold weather lol but i definitely recommend this jacket pay key attention to the heavy part of the this jacket it s not necessarily that heavy in weight but rather in insulation this is a very warm coat that is easily comfortable down to 0 degrees f unfortunately though much above 30 degrees f the jacket is far too warm it seems very well made and has deep pockets the hood fits easy over a winter hat or ball cap it is very wind resistant as well as water resistant in light snow or rain the only thing that seems missing is a zipper garage it doesn t really chafe my chin though with the way it snaps up tight but something to keep in mind if you have sensitive skin,men's clothing,0

shirts are not long enough to completely cover my stomach these do depending on what color is ordered the fits are different i have been ordering black as it had seemed like it was the best fit and ordering other colors they seem to fit smaller i liked the shirts and kingsize but it would be best if it could be more uniform with fit for each color received this shirt and the first thing i noticed was a horrible chemical smell coming off of them i bought 3 in different colors i aired them out overnight no change i spritzed them with febreeze and put them on the refresh cycle in my dryer no change washed them no change washed them a second time still stinks the polo s themselves are fine good fit and heavy duty fabric it took no less than 5 washings and drying outdoors to get the horrible stench of what ever the packing material or spray on that was used for shipping smelled like the worst dry cleaning additive ever one shirt is still not wearable washing for the 8th time i m 5 9 inches tall the extra length would look good on me if i were a full foot taller as is it fits like a night shirt i bought 2 so i made a double mistake it would have been better if the item description would have indicated one should be 6 ft 6in plus for a nice looking fit as i dont return items i will probably just donate them i am very disappointed with these shirts the sizing was terrible i bought 5 3xlt shirts only 2 were sized right the others would have been tight for a 2xlt plus i wash all new clothes in cold water and hang them on a clothesline to dry should have no problem with shrinkage and these shirts still shrank you have lost a customer the shirts are not 2 longer than any other 5xlt as they advertise these shirts use to be longer when they weren t made in china ever since they switched the length is not 2 longer laid two shirts one regular xlt and the new 2 longer on top of each other and they are same exact size the size was perfect for me but the added length was bad i am 6 4 and it was waaaaay to long for me i bought the 7xlt should have just gotten it in a 7xl big that was the only negative other than the length again the actual fit of the shirt was good they fit great and just what my husband needed for work love your clothing finally a place to allow my husband to look professional at an affordable cost well it truly does have an extended length in the back which is what wanted to try it does actually feel to me to be a bit too long but i think i got what i asked for i ordered the black white marble shirt and it looks great and fits great many people have complimented me on my choice plus it was at a good price never thought i d need something other than a tall but the length on these allow the shirt to stay tucked in comfortable fit accurate sizing need to buy on sale believe they are at regular retail over priced i bought several of these shirt and they were a good price on sale and well made kind of wish i would have bought the next size larger but that is on me i bought them a size above what i need and within 3 or 4 washings they were the size of oven mits waste of money the dark colors last longer than the light ones the material is top notch however the sizing is flawed i ordered a 5xlt and that u2019s what the tag showed but this shirt was closer to a 3xl if you buy this particular shirt i would recommend getting a size bigger than your normal love the extra length it s needed for those of us that are big and tall fit is good fabric has a good feel it s a much better value when it s on sale as it s not at the same level as designer versions one quible is the buttons the white buttons are not right with my black polo a darker bone or shell style button would have less contrast and still work ok with lighter colors comfortable keeps its shape washes well too soon to comment on its longevity but so far i would definitely buy it again my one complaint if you can even call it that is that due to the longer length it makes tucking in a little awkward after using the rest room a very minor problem that only takes a couple seconds to fix and it s worth it knowing you don t have to worry about plumber s crack at any point during the day,men's clothing,0

222,Rokka&Rolla Men's Lined Hooded Thickened Insulated Winter Parka Jacket Anorak Puffer Coat with Removable Faux Fur Trim,61.99,4.9,53.0,a near perfect coat don t spend hundreds for a winter parka warm fantastic coat size 2x i like a looser fit high quality as expected worth it ready for winter recommended very warm and stylish jacket runs big excellent stuff super comfortable and warm terrific winter coat at a reasonable price great coat for winter great coat ski parka amazing winter coat keeps you warm and dry super quality highly recommend,this is easily the best winter i have ever had it keeps you warm even if you re shoveling snow at zero degrees i m a big guy but it allows me to fully move around freely it doesn t bind me up like my past jackets the only problem with it is that the hood is a bit big for my head i got around it by wearing a winter hat under the hood otherwise a great coat so this is a pretty good jacket for the money it was able to keep me warm in 30 degree weather even when it was really windy when it gets really cold the only downside is the jacket feels like a thick piece of paper but at that level of coldness all that matters is that i feel warm i feel like this jacket will last me for many years to come i ordered and had this sent to my son who lives many states away he did say it ran a little big and had to downsize the seller was most accommodating and that made the experience all the better my son says it fits great and keeps him very warm which is very good to know highly recommend i have received many compliments on the appearance of this coat i live in chicago we have had some days below zero since i got the coat it was warm i have had the coat now for almost a year it has held up well the price is super fantastic for what you get i am 5 9 and 155 lbs i got a medium and it fits perfect i originally ordered a small going off the reviews my son wears a medium usually he is 5 9 and 145 lbs when i received the jacket i put it on and thought this was going to be tight on him so i then ordered a medium as well the medium is the size he likes my suggestion is to go with your regular size quality of the jacket is fantastic lots of pockets comfy hood and warm i would recommend this jacket perfect for me in chicago what i was looking for started to get the 900 one glad i didn t this works just fine great quality for the price my boyfriend likes the design he loves those big pockets w nice buttons it looks really nice on him and it fits well the material is very high quality and waterproof it can keep water out he said that the parka keeps excellent warmth so he feels so warm he likes the beige color and the fur color also matched with it very well the hood is detachable a little surprise the inner lining of hood is supper soft so it provides a lot comfort and warmth again it is a valuable parka the parka coat is excellent toasty warm and the color is very nice quality material and fits well i was so impressed by the quality that i plan on buying more styles from u guys i would definitely recommend it and put on this parka a great purchase personally i needed a coat for this winter i saw this one and it looks perfect in the photos but it looks better on me i m l so i ordered l and it fits as expected the quality it s very good and also it s warm and also in comfort with my body from 0 to 10 i give a 8 or 8 5 the only things is the faux that looks kind of weird to be honest but it s feels good let s see when i wash it one day how it goes very nice heavy coat for the winter great coat very warm i weight 275 and 5 10 bought the xxl great fit birtch is not as white as shown leans a bit khaki color but still light and that s what i wanted everyone has dark deep inside pocket oh and love the fact it s also rain proof fast delivery very pleased i am 6 2 ft and 230 lbs my wife purchased an xl for me but it is too big so i am going to return it so i can get a l instead jacket looks very nice and it looks very good quality so i am going to give it a shot i will post updates when i get the l i have not tried this in cold yet but will be in toronto in a week and will see how this handles 20 degree f however i can tell right away this is quality product it feels great folds easy has prefect amount of pockets and the hood feels decent with a tightening strap i switched to small and it s a perfect fit i m 5 8 155lbs i will update this after next weekend update i wore this in toronto when it was 10 deg f not much breeze this coat worked really well i had a flannel shirt sherpa lined hoodie and this coat i was very comfortable pockets are great only kind of down side is the hood isn t detachable but that s not a biggie update 2 i love this jacket i was in 5 deg f 18 ish feel like and this worked great i wore compression baselayer regular shirt hoodie and this jacket 11 people found this helpful this jacket is extremely comfortable it is by far the warmest jacket i own i ordered a medium i am 6ft 170 lbs and it fits perfect i will say though that when the jacket is zipped all the way up it does make access to your pants pockets difficult but thats the only small issue i have other than that it is great this coat is exactly what i was looking for i take a walk every day and i needed a coat that had a hood and would zip up to cover my chin this coat does exactly that and also is long enough to cover my thighs it is also insulated good enough so i don t need to wear a vest i would recommend this coat to anyone looking for a great cold weather garment excellent well made coat for new york city winters i am 5 5 140 lbs and the small size fit me properly with enough space for a sweater underneath i debated getting a size larger so i could wear a suit jacket beneath the coat but decided that i would give more avenues for cold air to blow in from below if the coat is too loose the coat is thigh length so the choice of using the zipper or the buttons depends on whether you will be walking or sitting the zipper isn t bi directional so if you will be seated for part of the trip while driving on the bus train then you must use the buttons the one way zipper only works if you are walking outside even with just the buttons i found it comfortably warm although would need the zipper closed if windy the pockets are not padded but if it s that cold you ll be wearing gloves anyway so not a problem this works very well with temperature in the teens don t feel any cold seeping through it is water resistant but i wouldn t wear this is a pouring rain if i m wearing this it s too cold for rain the fur hood is nice but i generally pair this with a vbiger knit scull cap anyway the fur is removable but i left it on so i don t lose it after purchasing i started seeing many people wearing rokka rolla coats so this is a popular choice in cold climates like that the fur collar can be detached the coat is a ski coat parka and keeps you very warm my teenage fashionista son loves it and lord knows he is picky designer this designer that he likes the black size large because even though he is tall slim medium was snug on him so his dad ended up with the first coat purchased another point the sleeve length was great for him my son his dad loves the light colored one he is slim and of average height fits him good size medium the coats made it through a winter season without any problems super warm coat it started wet snowing when i got out of work today first day i tried it out and this coat kept me warm and dry the water doesn t stick to it either cause it s water resistant i highly recommend this coat i live in buffalo ny and this is by far the warmest coat i own better than ones i spent hundreds of dollars on this coat is reasonable priced and super warm perfect for anyone looking for a solid deal on a great winter coat this coat is amazing the medium fit my 6ft 157lb son great there was plenty of room but if your going for a more fitted look i suggest sizing one down its super quality and looks expensive extremely happy with this purchase it was super warm i bought this jacket after reading some comments about how good it is i figured i should give it a try i can highly recommend this jacket it s very warm and durable i sometimes wear a t shirt underneath it in utah winter weather i ve been snowboarding with it and never felt cold even with just buttoning it up best jacket i ve ever bought,men's clothing,0
223,Dragon Ball Z Kame Kanji House Men's and Big Men's Graphic T-shirt,11.87,4.5,15.0,i love this shirt great quality comfortable cool t shirt nice shirt nice quality t shirt nice design dragon ball z men t shirt men s dragon ball z t shirt fan to dragon ball z black specks on logo dragon ball z t shirt,i love this shirt great quality men s dragon ball z kame kanji house symbol graphic t shirt this shirt in my opinion is above standard the quality is great and the image is perfect the image was what i was worried about when i was thinking about getting the shirt itself sometimes on cheaper shirts have images that are super heavy and when you wear the shirt itself you ll find yourself totally sweating wherever the image is located usually its because the image is caked on and thicker than any other part of the shirt this shirt s image is perfect its not heavy at all and you don t sweat where the image is the quality of the shirt itself is awesome in my opinion and its just right as far as being the perfect blend of cloth its not heavy and its not to light it s just right and perfect for a summer shirt or under shirt in the winter if you re layering up the image itself stands for dragon ball z which is a sort of anime cartoon and seems to be really popular with the kids these days overall i love the shirt its perfect in the cloth s weight the shirt itself to me is a above average shirt in quality and the image is perfectly balanced not causing sweat or any discomfort when wearing it in the hot house or on a hot summer day i would recommend this shirt to anyone at all highly recommended this is a very comfortable cotton shirt for every day wear the shirt is made in honduras and it is 100 cotton the fit is relaxed size m is marked to fit sizes 38 40 i m 5 6 and about 170 lbs right now i had a baby last month and i am all about comfort and loose fit and this shirt is great for both it is soft and machine washable i love the fact that there are no tags my husband likes dragon ball z but he is not familiar with the print on this particular shirt i like the contrast of white and red on black background the emblem is designed to look slightly distressed and it looks like it will wear down nicely as the time goes on emblem is made of the rubbery type of material that reminds me of the type that you iron onto the fabric i like the vintage look of it and how comfortable it is it is a good shirt for chilling around the house working out or even running errands the fit is definitely unisex but on a looser side so if you like your t shirts to be more fitted buy a size lower than your actual size this men s t shirt is i think really well made it is very soft and has a crew neck which i much rather prefer to the v neck style t shirts it is made of a cotton and polyester blend this keeps it from shrinking the way 100 cotton would do if dried in a dryer i like the bright coloring and i think that the screen printing should last through many washings the big test usually for most shirts is how the graphic holds up under drying a lot of times the graphic will start to peel or bubble so far this has not happened with this shirt i am not a huge fan of anime but i have heard of dragon ball z and my grandson was impressed when i showed him that i got this t shirt i like the symbol on the front of the shirt it reminds me of loved ones i have from japan even though i don t know much about the dragon ball z franchise i do know this is the ancient scripture for japanese writing and that i like the shirt is made of a nice soft 100 cotton material and will go nicely with my orange sweatshirt i just bought the feel of the fabric is nice and soft the color of the graphic was good and a fun design my husband liked the fit it washed and dried without shrinking i would definitely recommend checking out this t shirt line if you are in the market for one i received the dragon bail kanji house symbol shirt a couple of days ago i ordered it for my son from the walmart spark reviewer program the fabric of the t shirt is a good quality shirt not too heavy but not too thin either the screen print design is rather large covering almost the whole width of the t shirt the design is only a white background with a red symbol i m not sure if the manufacturer meant to have the ink of the printed design to not be totally solid or not it is not if the shirt was printed this way on purpose for me it looks more like a defect in the screen printing process aside from this issue for me i think the design is very nice and so does my son the only size available was a medium my son is a smaller statured size so the medium is a little large still looks fine on and him he likes the shirt seems like most people like to wear oversized t shirts nowadays anyway the t shirt is made of 100 cotton it s hard to tell how much a garment will shrink when it s 100 cotton i found that when you want them to shrink they don t and vice versa the t shirt washed well and did not shrink much i forgot to measure it before washing as i ve done with other clothing in the past however the shirt is still a little big which is why i say it didn t shrink much this men s dragon ball z kame kanji house symbol graphic t shirt picked or my son which is right up his personal taste since he likes gaming and dragon ball z the fit size color construction and printed design is fine the fabric held up well during wash and drying with really not much shrinkage at all so fit stayed the same also fabric remained soft the seams and how it was made is good son really like logo since seems old world and likes the game the length was particularly great on men s dragon ball z kame kanji house symbol graphic t shirt as my son is long on the torso so length was perfect for him overall the men s dragon ball z kame kanji house symbol graphic t shirt is good and looks great on the men s dragon ball z kame kanji house symbol graphic t shirt looks good fit well black color and logo is nice t shirt came out great during wash and dry it s made well would recommend purchase of this men s dragon ball z kame kanji house symbol graphic t shirt this is a review for a men s t shirt size m with the dragon ball logo the background color is black the seal is on the front and covers the entire central area of the chest in white background and orange letters the impression is not of good quality so avoid using a dryer and do not iron the printing area this way it will last longer it is a good option to walk the pet go to the market or be at home it is not for formal occasions or semi formal it is for informal occasions it is light and fresh size m is somewhat wide but shrinks a little after washing it is a mixture of cotton and polyester the neck is round my son has watched all the dragon ball series since he was a child so he was excited it can be a detail for a person who likes dragon ball z the dragon ball z men s t shirt is 100 cotton the size medium 38 40 is a good true medium and is a crew neck it is a nice thickness and not too thin so i think it will last a long time it is machine in cold water and tumble dry low do not iron or dry clean because of the silkscreen printed house logo i love the logo but i think the print was not done properly because there are a lot of black speckles on the white background and it is very noticeable it gives the logo an old worn look which is fine but i do not think it is supposed to be that way i tried washing it to see if the speckles come off thinking it is lint from the black shirt but to no avail the speckles are still there i must point out that this black stuff is not because the white print has rubbed off or cracked in any way i still like this shirt but i would hesitate to gift it because of the flaws i always turn t shirts inside out to wash so the logo prints will last longer as well a good feature is that this t shirt is tagless as well well son liked shirt it s black and he s a gamer so what can i say the men s dragon ball z kame kanji house symbol graphic t shirt wore well as expected and no stretching on neckline some others do the shirt fabric is a bit light so good for warmer weather like here in florida it washed well didn t notice lot of shrinkage and so far no color fading it had the normal wrinkles you expect of a t shirt coming out of the dryer so nothing unusual about that the construction and sewing on it is good son like the worn out logo look like it s design the shirt fit was spot on like my son like wearing his shirts and specially on the lengthwise since his torso is long well son is ok with the shirt and is fine wearing and looks good so thumbs up on this t shirt,men's clothing,1

236,KingSize Men's Big & Tall ™ Double-Breasted Wool Peacoat Coat,109.99,4.2,60.0,617beantown men peacoat a bit of memory warm winter coat nice coat nice coat not real peacoat design arms are bigger than chest of coat wife points tall apparently means nothing over 6 1 actually i did buy it again comically too large excellent quality great fit not even close to the navy s not what was expected peacoat quality is lacking not true to size at all,nice my favorite color thanks for prompt delivery received my order today great quality my husband like it will purchase more in the future amazing coat with great sizes i love the colors of choice it would be awesome if they offered other choices like old british red or army officer green but it s still an amazing product i love the traditional naval buttons also this product should be offered all year around and not just fall and winter i m not sure but for decades i ve always wanted a navy peacoat maybe it s the double buttons maybe it s the simple drape of the wool but a navy peacoat always gave me the impression of being warm comfortable and ready to take on any weather i went for the navy color as i wear a lot of blue and complimentary colors i needed a solid winter coat for the rain and wind i also needed a coat that was comfortable easy to cart around and had a more universal look i went for the tall because i have long arms i also went for a size larger because i like roomy rather than form fitting a good fit one of these days i ll get that flying tiger flight jacket good quality heavy wool wears well keeps out the cold sleeves are long enough shoulders are wide enough my husband really likes his new coat except a button fell soon after started wearing it why don t manufacturers sew buttons on tightly i have wanted a pea coat for a long time and the sale price offered made it within my price range i feel the coat runs on the large side but know i can wear bulky clothing under it and it will still fit it is warm and looks good it is dryclean only so can t speak to how it will do after having it cleaned all in all i would recommend anyone who has ever owned or wore a real navy peacoat will tell you this aint it good fabric yes heavy duty no collar dimensions no way off collar section should be about 4 inches all the way around it was designed to beep the back of your head and ears completely covered when turned up with sailor cap turned down gave complete coverage for being on deck in foul weather it is ok for a coat it is a failure of design and function as a peacoat the sleeves were waaay too long so i have returned for an exchange for a smaller size i hope it works my husband is usually a solid 3xlt but this did not work hoping the 2xlt works prompt delivery hoping the exchange goes as smoothly arms are way too big and baggy jacket fits fine in chest and arms my wife bought this as a gift i really love the coat and received a lot of compliments the biggest issue i have is my hands and clothing underneath had the dye from the coat all over them the label states to not wash the coat i would suggest using other materials to achieve the coloring because blue hands and are not a good look while the cost was wide enough it is not near long enough in the body i am 6 5 and this coat falls to just above belt height which is not how a pea coat should fit it should be vented in the tail and go down to just below hip level the material is fine but not heavy also a proper pea coat has a button behind the lapel this one does not for the money there are way better options out there i originally ordered the 3xl size in long as per the sizing chart and what i usually wear i m a big guy 6ft 3in and 280 lbs when i received and tried on the 3xl i was swimming in it i re ordered it in the 2xl long but kept the 3xl until i received the 2xl one the 2xl long fit much better but still left enough room in it so that i didn t feel constricted i then returned the 3xl and got credit minus the re stocking service charge i bought this as a gift for my boyfriend i followed the size chart exactly and even measured him to be certain however when it came in the mail it was comically too large according to the size chart he should be a 5x but i m thinking it s more like a 3x now that i have seen this on him bought as a gift to my son i m not a big fan of shopping online but this is the most user friendly helpful site i have ever shopped on let me know every step of the way when it was shipped where it was and when it was delivered love the quality of the product and the great service my son is thin but very tall and long armed and this coat was a fabulous fit if you are looking for a good ole fashioned navy peacoat then this is not for you it is not nearly as heavy and thick as a true heavenly navy peacoat however i still like it it still keeps me warm and it still looks nice my only drawbacks is that the sleeve length is about 1 inch to long as well as both outer pockets being sewn shut easy fixes tho and able to be fixed by anyone easily if you are going to spend this kind of money on this coat wait until there bogo buy one get one free sale near november or there 50 off black friday cyber monday sales it makes it totally worth it then i wear a 4 5x routinely since this is an overcoat my wife got it in the 5x just to be certain that it would be roomy enough with an entire outfit on underneath this coat swallows me in the 5x way way off in size in my personal opinion she is returning it for a 3 hoping that it will fit properly other than that it s fine the buttons are a bit cheesy with anchors on them but the color is nice and it was the right price when it arrived it smelled a bit had to have it dry cleaned i suspect that was from the packaging etc it smelled chemically the outside pockets were sewn shut for some reason had to have that fixed overall i love the coat it s warm and roomy and looks exactly like i think pea coat should look bought this jacket because it was at an acceptable price point for the size the wool fabric and lining were of a light lesser quality the jacket arrived without a right pocket the fit was too short in the torso and too long in the sleeves decided to have a seamstress rectify the issues i bought this coat for my boyfriend and all of his coats and clothing are 2xl and this coat is huge on him i was able to get into this coat with him and its a peacoat not happy with this coat at all returning it as soon as possible,men's clothing,0

240,ORORO Men's Lightweight Padded Heated Jacket with SMAWARM Insulation and Detachable Hood (Battery Included),139.99,4.9,54.0,stealth heated jacket hooded jacket vest very good deal great jacket great jacket and great customer service it s like wearing an electric blanket initially i thought it was a bit thin but how wrong really wind proff and so warm even when not on very happy overall christmas gift toasty warm amazing happy hubby worked well skiing in utah amazing very light and warm dog walking jacket,great jacket water resistant worm even without heating turned on i love the fact that on off button is positioned on the inside of the jacket and light is not visible from the outside making it stealth heated jacket only thing that would make this jacket perfect are zippers on the outer pockets this is a potential problem if you are carrying couple of items and if they can t fit in the inner zipped pocket still 5 star jacket worth the money it is a beautiful jacket i am thrilled to have this jacket i am impressed with snap buttons on the jacket too i also have your heated vest which is great also i have been using the vest every day can t wait to use the jacket when colder temperatures come our way which should be any day i am already amazed how well the vest heats up especially around the collar too just purchased the fleece jacket and their new hooded jacket and i love them just like i love my other jackets and west from ororo they will keep nice and warm this winter on my bike commute to work at 4 am bought it on black friday and got a very good deal and i am blown away how fast i get it all the way to denmark bought this for my honey who plows snow all winter long and for my son who lives in the city and walks everywhere they love it it s great as a light weight jacket when you don t need the heat but when you do it heats up quickly in all the right spots will order again for myself i purchased this as a christmas gift for my husband who has wanted one ever since he saw my cousin with one and thought it was the best invention ever i had to come up with many crafty excuses to prevent him from purchasing one himself lol anyway christmas day was a very surprising and exciting one for him when he opened the box and saw the ororo label he couldn t believe it and after kissing me all over my face lol he immediately went and charged it and hasn t taken it off he retired all of his other outerwear because he has an ororo and that s all he needs it was by far one of the best if not the best gift i ve ever given him with the exception of our children of course now he s always toasty warm in this cold new york city winter weather i got this for my husband for christmas he loves it it keeps him very warm i also ordered an extra battery the extra battery was lost somewhere along the way and before i could even contact ororo they contacted me they told me the package was lost and that they would send another which they did immediately it arrived quickly and as nice as ororo is they contacted me again to make sure everything was correct what a great way to run a company i have owned the jacket for 2 months it s a comfortable jacket it fits well and it s cozy my 1st impression was that it looked light my concern was that it wouldn t shield me from the cold i live in canada and most of the time i go outside i have no need to turn the heat on as long as the weather doesn t dip below zero when it does i typically use the hottest setting i often don t wear anything bulky under my coat and the jacket keeps me toasty even when i wear a light sweater i wish the jacket had a warmer setting because the maximum setting is not as warm as i prefer i work outside some days and the jacket keeps me warm i have no need to stuff my coat pockets with heat packs like some of my coworkers i do not feel hot when the jacket is set at at its highest heat setting i am comfortable i tend to use a lower heat setting when i step on transit or step inside the jackets price is good value i would rather buy another ororo jacket over a ridiculously expensive unethical canada goose jacket plus you don t need to over extend yourself financially to make a fashion statement because my coworkers noticed my heated jacket immediately when they noticed the button light when i powered it on i prefer if the power button did not light up because i don t like drawing attention to my heated jacket anyway it s a great investment i hope the company includes 2 batteries with future purchases because the cost of batteries are expensive i recommend the jacket lightweight comfortable good value battery lasts just wish i found it years ago great jacket even when not using the heating elements only wish is that the on off switch would be on the outside so it s easier to get to but it has become my go to jacket i ordered this for my boyfriend who works outside as a christmas gift he loves it and will definitely be wearing it for work it arrived quickly and in perfect condition for anyone that does outdoor activities or work in cold weather is crazy not to get this the fit is true to size the battery life lasts all day and it s adjustable heat temperatures absolutely love it buy it my husband works in a very cold warehouse he used to be exhausted by the cold not any longer he comes home happy because he s been warm all day i bought this for my husband to go skiing and it kept him warm especially on the chair lift battery worked all day long this is a great jacket it is very lightweight and well insulated it heats up fast and blocks the wind this has been a good purchase thus far my son loves it had to call and customer service is amazing so i bought another one for my uncle and heated gloves for me amazing i m a canine handler and i work long hours outside in the cold this jacket is amazing i m toasty warm thank you i did a lot of homework before i finally decided to buy a heated jacket and the main features for me was lightweight heated pockets a zippered inside pocket for a phone wallet or whatever and even though i hardly ever wear one i wanted to have a detachable hood this jacket has it all walking my dogs means my gloves are constantly coming on and off so the heated pockets is so handy i can pretty much leave one glove at home anyone who does walk a dog will appreciate that when they are handing out treats or picking up waste the jacket for me was a mens small which fits true to size and it is so light the battery fits nicely into the left zippered pocket and is hardly noticeable took it out yesterday for the first test and it was minus 12 c i had the jacket on low and it worked great the wind was blowing but the jacket did a great job keeping it out it also has a water resistant full length zipper and storm cuffs maybe there next generation model could have zippered pockets to keep things like mitts or treats from falling out otherwise i think i made a wise purchase the fabric on this appears easy to clean as i found out yesterday when a dog with muddy paws jumped up to say hello when i got back i simply took a damp cloth and everything wiped up like new first heated jacket here are my first impressions npros ndetachable hood nstyling nheats up fast n ncons nbattery pack is heavy not your fault tech needs to design a long thin and flat battery for these purposes nshoulders can get cold while the rest is toasty n nconclusion ni am satisfied with my purchase if it were stolen tomorrow i would replace it with another n nwishes nvest with hidden on off button nheated gloves hood accessories nshoulder heating n nall in all nicely done keep perfecting it and the sky s the limit this jacket is incredible can t beat it for early morning outdoor

245,Hanes Men's 1901 Heritage Fleece Full Zip Hoodie,19.0,4.1,51.0,nice hoodie soft material good fit overall nice design a great jacket the perfect hoodie has arrived the perfect hoodie poor quality of fabric hanes men s 1901 heritage fleece full zip hoodie looks and feels soft 1 hole after washing substandard product broken zipper do not wash love the hoodie good quality and very comfortable small ish not happy got a hole after 1 wash looks good tho love the color handsome hoodie nice vintage look well cut and flattering fit not happy,the hoodie appears to be good quality the inside of the hood itself is smooth while the rest of the inner hoodie is made of soft texture type cotton hopefully it lasts a long time and doesn t pill zippers appear to be strong and sturdy this hoodie also has a vintage appearance this review was collected as part of a promotion i am very happy with this zip hoodie so far i was initially attracted to it due to the color the dark blue has specs of white in it giving the hoodie a unique look in terms of the color the material is quite soft on the inside and outside and feels very comfortable in my opinion in terms of build it seems to be well made for a medium the sizing seems very good and fits me well the front pockets are nice but they are not very deep overall i am quite happy with this hoodie this review was collected as part of a promotion perfect lightweight hoodie to keep warm and comfy love these hoodies ordered one and then ordered three more since i liked them so much nice drape and cut and the large fits as excepted and i like the subtle vintage discoloration in the weave perfect in every respect size weight zip how the hood falls raglan cut only wish it came in black and every other color it doesn t come in yet not really fleece like fabric on both sides exterior side is fine knit that pulls easily and is very thin i have cats and they knead their claws on the jacket and seem to enjoy it i am not happy at all with this fabric i ve worn it twice and it already looks old and shabby love the hoodie hated the fact that the color ran into my other clothes the first time i washed it feels soft and comfortable but does not wash well after one wash in warm water it has a small hole in the back the zipper is very difficult to start and unhook zipper is substandard will not buy another hanes product the zipper was broken upon receipt to be clear it was already broken when i took it out of the bag i bought one and loved it until the third time i washed it when the zipper just disintegrated into rusted dust so i bought another one and its zipper lasted four washes don t waste your money i am very pleased with the quality of the fabric and the look hoodie i like the brass tone zipper good quality mid weight sweat jacket very comfortable nice jacket but it was uncomfortably snug so i had to return it not happy got a hole after 1 wash looks good tho it has light pilling and looks very warn after warm wash so only wash in cold i have a hole in the back lf the garment after 1 wash deal breaker worth the price really check your measurements i think they run a little small i am 5 1 110 pounds and i got a medium and it fit perfect i normally wear a small this is a cool hoodie it is a comfortable sans the bulky feeling layer against the winds it has a slim fit which is great when i need to add a parka the twist on this classic garment is the color it was listed as dark scree but in reality it is a sun faded navy which to my surprise looks great with all of my dark denim the color gives the hoodie a worn broken in look without the fabric being compromised i washed the hoodie in cold water and it was line dried so far no shrinkage or fading this review was collected as part of a promotion i was looking for a new hoodie and this one has some nice features it is a medium weight pre shrunk hoodie with a soft feel and vintage look the full length zipper makes it easy to put on and the fleece lining adds some warmth the color will probably fade slightly and the material will probably become even softer with repeated washings great for casual wear or layering this review was collected as part of a promotion this jacket not only looks good but it has a nice fit it does not fit too baggy and looks rather chic with a nice pair of jeans it is very nice because the material is nice and soft but not sloppy looking so it feels soft and pairs nicely with any variety of slacks for a well tailored look i think it is a really good addition to a wardrobe because of its all around usability my son loves it definitely will buy more in another color this review was collected as part of a promotion the inside fabric of the jacket and pockets is very rough and pilling as if this product was washed 100 times over many years however the outside fabric is nice and soft the jacket runs true to size this review was collected as part of a promotion,men's clothing,0

249,"Thermajohn Men Short Sleeve Baselayer Cool Dry Compression T-Shirt for Athletic Workout and Running (Medium, Raglan - Light Steel Grey)",18.99,4.6,91.0,i love it thermajohn compression t shirt tailored for style fits and feels amazing great fit this t shirt is quality quality quality awesome compression t perfect fit flexibility and mobility thermajohn athletic compression shirt doesn t fit me the way i thought it would good quality for reasonable cost great compression shirt great compression t shirt for exercising excellent t shirt a great men compression t shirt snug strong and stretchy nice workout shirt tight fit lightweight and great workout shirt 2nd sling for your body,i ordered xl size i normally fit in l size but i usually prefer to wear xl size to feel more comfortable so i was very surprised that it fitted me very well not too tight not too loose which would hinder sport activities i also like that the lower part is long to protect my waist from wind see picture but the most noticeable feature is it really keeps from heat and cold weather i can still feel the wind but not the cold the parts that aren t covered are the only areas that i feel the weather of course it can t withstand extreme weather but it does quite a good job first impression for me was the looks of this great fitting compression t shirt thermajohn compression t shirt is light weight and made to last thermajohn dry compression t shirt is what it means by that it does seem cooler wearing it temperature wise thermajohn men short sleeve baselayer cool dry compression t shirt feels great on the skin thermajohn is great for working out and walking or jogging t shirt is also stylish and would be great wearing going out on the town i love it the texture and everything about this thermal john tee shirt i highly recommend this to everyone that works out our just wants a comfortable tee shirt to just wear around if i were you i would get this hands down know questions asked i highly recommend this to everyone 10 10 all day everyday thank you for the opportunity i can t wait for more i wasn t sure how this shirt would fit considering i ve worn compression shirts before and usually have to strip them off after about five minutes of movement because they are too constricting and too hot however as soon as i put this shirt on i realized it fit differently than the others i ve tried it fits snug around the arms and shoulders but is just loose enough at the waist that it doesn t feel like i m being suffocated i received the large which states that it should be a good fit for someone with a 40 chest i would normally wear a 42 so that s where i can see the snugness coming in for reference i am 5 10 190 and work out roughly four times per week i like that i can wash this with colors or whites and then toss it into the dryer on low easy peasy this is going to come in nicely for that one extra layer on days i need to warm up just a little more at the gym or on a walk jog when i opened the package i could see that this was a high quality well made product the stitching of the seams is very well done and it s evident that this shirt will last a long time it s cool and comfortable when wearing during my workout and it looks so good it fits very well and looks as if it was tailored just for me this t shirt can also be worn for everyday use if you check out this t shirt you ll buy a couple who can resist well worth the price tried it on as soon as it was delivered i m 6 190 lbs and the large that was sent fits like a glove neutral color of grey was sent which is fine color really doesn t matter very nice compression t shirt i ll be wearing it regularly i ordered size 2xl in the dark blue and it fit my large body just right feels real good not real tight just a good snug fit seems to be very good quality i ve wore compression shorts and even socks before so i was anxious to try this shirt out the sizing was appropriate to other t shirts i wear so stick with that due the stay at home guidance i worked it in my basement and the shirt was very comfortable and actually kept me cooler than normal during my workout i am looking forward to wearing it on runs because of this quality i enjoyed the stretchability of the fabric and this will become a stable in my workout clothing apparel bonus for guys it shows off your upper body and also presents a slimming appearance this is a thermajohn athletic performance compression shirt it is moisture wicking and 4 way stretch construction is 87 polyester and 13 elastic jersey the piping appears to be reflective this particular item says small and it is cut small nice quality well sewn and quick dry made in china it s called cool dry but i got hot pretty quick and i wasn t even doing anything idk i guess i need to sweat for it to cool me down i assumed compression meant it would be tight which it was a little uncomfortably tight around my arms and neck but it was not tight at all around my chest or slightly oversized stomach it is a nice material and looks very nice when worn it just doesn t fit me the way i felt like a compression shirt should this thermajohn compression t shirt is exactly what is advertised and seems to be high quality so far i ordered x large because that is the regular size of shirt that i wear at first it seemed like it was going to be too tight of a fit but the more i wore it the more comfortable i realized that it was and that the size was just right for me of course i also knew that a compression shirt is designed to be a somewhat snug fit i am not really into working out i stay more in shape by working outside on our property cutting wood working in my shop etc but i really like the feel and look of this shirt for just going out on the town for dinner etc i have also found myself lounging around the house in it because it is so lightweight and comfortable the look and feel of the shirt really remind me a lot of the under armor brand of clothing and this line of clothing is a great value for the quality i would make sure to follow the cleaning instructions carefully drying this type of clothing with medium or high heat can shrink and weaken the mostly polyester material i usually prefer to just air dry clothing like this these shirts are a good quality for the price i started working out getting old just so sore afterward decided to give this a try i m a little impressed i was less sore and more dry well i don t feel wet like i did with a plain t shirt i was thinking it will stretch over time but the construction of it have these heavier band sewed in to really compress your body so far i like it this thermajohn men compression t shirt feels very comfortable to wear and it s breathable so it helps to reduce odor and sweating while exercising the material is machine washable and fairly easy to maintain and clean i like the fit and the look of the t shirt as well i received my thermajohn men short sleeve baselayer cool dry compression t shirt for athletic workout and running last week the thermajohn men short sleeve baselayer cool dry compression t shirt for athletic workout and running is maid with 87 polyester and 13 elastic jersey it is machine washable in cold water gentle cycle tumble dry on low heat i really like the feel on my skin it is very comfortable if you are working out or just going for a walk on a warm day i do recommend the thermajohn men short sleeve baselayer cool dry compression t shirt for athletic workout and running the thermajohn men short sleeve baselayer cool dry compression t shirt for athletic workout and running is a great compression t shirt i am an older guy who works out at the gym some and does things like golf kayaking and hiking but nothing too strenuous so i am probably not the best guy to review a compression shirt but i have to say that wearing it while doing my activities seemed to give me more endurance and i definitely did not get tired as quickly as usual i fits great and even helps hold in my belly i like how it makes my biceps look better and it definitely kept me feeling dryer when i was sweating as for helping me after a workout i probably do not work out hard enough to see feel or notice those benefits but if it might be helping then i will keep wearing it so if you are looking for a compression t shirt i recommend giving the thermajohn men short sleeve baselayer cool dry compression t shirt a try the thermajohn men short sleeve baselayer cool dry compression t shirt for athletic workout and running fits true to size is fairly long in the torso making it easy to tuck in and has good sleeve lengths and a comfortable collar the material is thin but you can tell it s strong i have no complaints about this shirt and think it lives up to what thermajohn advertises recommended i found this shirt to be a nice lightweight shirt the shirt is form fitting i got mine oversized but almost wish i hadn t the material is very breathable and makes for a great shirt to wear when involved in physical activity or in very warm weather it can be used as a baselayer or it is fashionable enough to wear by itself as an outer layer i found it to keep me cooler and dryer then most of my other apparel the light gray color is nice if out in the sun it is not absorbing the heat from the sun as do many darker colors almost immediately the letter from the logo started pealing but this has no effect on the quality of the shirt i needed a new exercise workout shirt so i tried the thermajohn men short sleeve baselayer cool dry compression t shirt for athletic workout and running it is a nice looking shirt and the material is soft and flexible it doesn t stretch at all i guess if your really thin and in shape this would be a good choice however i am 5 9 and 225 pounds i wear 2x shirts it came in 2x so i got it when i put the shirt on it was really tight like a medium and it was not comfortable i want to be able to breathe while i am exercising i would have to be 50lbs lighter to fit comfortably in the shirt i received the product from the spark reviewer program this shirt is made with high quality and looks and feels good wicks the sweat away so your not staying wet from all that sweat all the time feels very comfortable and made with quality materials if your looking for a everyday workout shirt or something to throw on to work out in the garden you need to try i reccomend it and you wont be disappointed thanks for a great product thermajohn compression shirt size length 28 shoulder to shoulder 16 5 sleeve length 6 5 inch for a medium size 87 polyester 13 elastic jersey made in china the elasticity will stretch to your body form and looks nice as long as you don t a have beer belly for when you re at the gym or casual it keeps you cool by pulling away the sweat the reason i m giving it 3 stars is the small part of the stitching on the shoulder is blue but the rest are white did they run out of white and finished it off with blue check out the photos,men's clothing,0

fit comfortably fortunately for me the new shirts that i bought from here are perfect the cut is great i don t have to stretch them out to wear them comfortably and like it says they don t shrink in the wash the sizing is important and these fit very well being that they are longer for anyone more long waisted or with a little more girth these were on sale when i bought them and they were less expensive than the ones i could purchase locally from a commpetator so were a great value for the money these shirt are a staple in our wardrobe there is a nice selection of colors and they re well made i have some of these i ve had for years and stll wearing the and so does my husband nothing more comfy with so much around the house time as a soft comfy t shirt i like the shirts but for some reason some of them not all of them tend to be extremely long i m 6 6 and the bottom of the shirts came down to below mid thigh i had to ask my wife to take them up a few inches you should talk to your designers or manufacturers about this i really like these t shirts especially compared to dxl s harbor bay which have truly become garbage these shirts are very comfortable they seem to wash pretty well i hang dry them and they look clean for the price they re definitely worth it i like to wear dark solid colors and these shirts fit the bill what i believe makes them good and short of great is the neck collar of the shirt they re a bit large and as a result makes them feel a bit stretched out even though i don t think they are if the neck of the shirt was about 1 2 inches smaller these would be a 10 10 for what i ve found the neck isn t a huge deal and they re definitely the best around these shirts are ok if you don t mind the neck area opening to not keep it s shape while wearing it better off with foundry t shirts nothing i cannot stand more than a t shirt with a stretched out collar if it was made a smaller opening size it would rate better other thsn that it s a quality t shirt this and most all of the shirts i have gotten from kingsize do not wash well the fade quickly unless something most anything is spilled on the shirt that spill locks in the color as time goes on those stain s stains get more prominent seem to always shrink if they can be picked up with a discount for 12 to 15 they are an ok 4 out of 10 rating the lightweight fabric is great the quality of construction awful if you like your shirts with a pre stretched rippled neckline and hems on the sleeves and bottom of the shirt permanently twisted this is the shirt for you quality control is nonexistent i ordered these in multiple colors and almost every one of them has a significant problem will never order them again very poor quality the shirt was like you had wore it and all stretched out the neck of the t shirt hang down to low dont ever plan on buying this shirt again i bought one in black and it collected lent like crazy picked up everything was imberiest to wear it out it was almost like you wanted to either wear them as under shirts or over shirts with another shirt under it shirt fits true to size for me and is a great style and color black marble very pleased with this purchase one of the shirts had an un stiched seam that was about two inches long another one had a hole in the back and one in the pocket my husband lives in these t shirts he insists on having a pocket these are comfortable and affordable the only drawback is that they do seem to shrink and fade a little with repeated washings order them 2 3 times a year these are excellent lightweight shirts for summer especially in the deep south where i live they re cool fit well and work both on their own and worn under a button down shirt to the office everything i have purchased has been of high quality whether it be t shirts sweatpants pull overs underwear socks etc my son loves them and tell me that these are made well and the quality is outstanding he loves kingsize products seems to be of good quality and it feels the same as a regular tee i have washed and dried it twice but no shrinkage it does still have the age old turning up at the cuff and bottom i wasn t sure what to expect and am very pleased with what i got these shirts are comfortable good looking and fit perfectly i intend to buy a lot more my husband loves these tshirts he will not wear any other tshirt very comfortable and no shrinking great summer weight tee soft to the touch the pocket is perfect for my cell phone good sizing did not shrink after 1st wash if i didn t buy so many the first time i would get more highly recomrnded my husband lives in these shirts they are comfortable and cool the shirt fits well without being too tight or too baggy it also holds its shape after being washed many times he has a drawer ful and i am always on the look out for new colors,men's clothing,0
263,Men's Cool 18® Pro Flat Front Shorts Regular Fit HS00438,42.4,4.6,159.0,very comfortable shorts great fit and comfy i came back to order more comfortable and easy care great shorts shorts that are the best great shorts great value cool pro 18 i m happy with them just what i expected good quality great delivery always a win great shorts changes to last years great fit shorts great shorts nice shorts perfect color fit,i love the feel look of these shorts the expandable waistband is a welcome feature just slipped these right on when they arrived i knew immediately i d made a good purchase cool comfortable stylish shorts i bought these a month ago for work and have yet to wear them we are closed until further notice so i have been lounging in basketball shorts or pajama pants that being said i have bought the cool 18 shorts for work every year for the last 7 years the material is soft and comfortable they are wrinkle free which is a plus also they look good it s good to have a comfortable pair of shorts that looks professional on a side note i also buy the cool 18 pants for winter time i was so pleased with my first pair of cool 18 pro shorts that i ordered three more the navy color was out of stock by the time my order was processed but the other two look great these will be excellent for travel because they dry quickly even when hung up indoors the instructions said to avoid using dryer sheets so i threw these in the dryer separately and they dried in just a few minutes they would probably dry fine hanging up overnight meaning they d be good for travel they are comfortable fit well and don t wrinkle the way cotton shorts do i have worn these shorts for many years and when it came time to get a new pair i did not even consider another brand the shorts are good looking light cool and very durable the best part is the expandable waistband which means that the shorts always fit perfectly i have bought 14 pairs as i have two homes and keep 7 in each location they are great for golf as they give on the swing look great right from the washing machine my husband loves the extra give in the waistband they are cool for playing golf in the arizona heat they wash and dry well we bought 2 pair and the light blue color is lovely have bought these many times in the past since i m between sizes these always have a great fit and are extremely comfortable and wick away moisture with the great sales price i added 6 more pair to my wardrobe i have always liked the haggar line of shorts and these 2 pair of haggar cool pro 18 s are great especially with the stretch feature especially at work where i am always on my feet 10 hours a day always moving and bending they are lighter weight than i expected that makes them better in hot weather i think because of the light weight they feel a little synthetic but overall i like them i just received my new shorts just in time my old ones were really showing their wear il like haggar shorts they a ways fit me well and they wear well my only complaints about the purchase were about the lack of certain colors in my size bought three pairs tan white and khaki delivered when promised order was correct fit was good as was the quality had a little trouble ordering put in the wrong zip code customer service was very helpful in getting it corrected older teen sons and hubby all like the way these feel and look on them they are each built very differently the shorts can be dressed up or down and lay wear nicely easy to wash and dry no ironing great shorts great price great value i m writing this review in my cool 18 dress shorts 5 hours after getting home from work so comfortable don t want to take them off i have worn these shorts for years buying several new pair each year have always loved the fit and feel and easy care for here in florida just bought 8 pair of various colors material and waist 34 fit are as in past my complaint is the rise in new shorts is about 2 shorter than last year not comfortable especially when sitting will try on next time and if the same these were my last i ve been buying hagger shorts for years they look great and the expanding waist band make the shorts exceptionally comfortable jl great quality these shorts are comfortable you have to buy the next size up since all of their clothes seem to run smaller than normal purchased these shorts for my husband in two colors and he loves them he says very comfy for golf the shorts are very well made but they are 100 polyester and i prefer the cotton spandex mixture which are less dressy yes had bought all other four colors and could not fine harvest tan khaki great product easy to clean comfortable to wear,men's clothing,0

these are not for my son who is tall 5 9 and very slim material was nice but they did fit right at all got a pair of pants that were from the same company and the same measurements but for some reason these seemed much longer for slim fit they were wider at the bottom then the straight fit which didn t seem right either this review was collected as part of a promotion i wear these even when i m not playing golf there is probably some elastic in the blend because they really flex while sitting and squatting they also fit very well too guys with very muscular legs can wear these but it ll be tight

want to wear a heavy sweater underneath i live in coastal oregon so they will be warm enough these jackets are so useful to throw in the car as they pack small i also like that you can remove the hood

colors it is light weight and with the slim waistline design its very flattering tts and roomy enough for layering the internal pocket with pictorial instructions to fold this jacket is perfect for traveling too we are still in the 100 degree here not sure if it s able to keep warm well because it is thin but definitely good to have for light winter in houston i really like it color is really cute and it s so comfortable and pretty i really like it color is so cool and pretty also it s so comfortable i m so satisfied with that i got my true size and it fits perfect i can still fit a couple of layers underneath but it also does not look too bulky if i do not add layers it keeps me really warm and has a slimming waist also has fleece lined pockets that are an added bonus i m so impressed with this jacket i ve been wanting a puffer and this did not disappoint it s true to size warm yet light weight and cute i love that it has a hood purchased in black size small 5 4 115 lbs and i can wear a sweater under it comfortably its thin but it has fleece on the inside so it quite warm plus you can layer w out it being tight or uncomfortable plus it nice on windy days the material is good for a cute windbreaker all in all i really don t have any complaints i think its a steal for 19 99 fits and looks great warm enough for chilly weather up north with room for a sweatshirt underneath it is a bit roomy but was perfect when i added a few layers underneath love that the hood is removable and the pockets are lined so my hands stay extra warm great color choices very cozy and warm lightweight and versatile for any occasion the zipper looks classy in its rose gold to match my pink jacket but my only complaint is that the zipper gets caught up in the jacket a lot and i have to adjust it other than that i love this jacket for the price i was disappointed to learn that the hood is actually very big it would be fine if there was a drawstring or something to close it even when i wore a hat it was still standing out on the sides way too big for a size large jacket nthe fabric keeps getting stuck in the zipper when zipping up or down love love love these jacket s i originally purchased a black one at the store a couple of months ago i recently just purchased 3 more in different colors because i like them so much i usually wear a large in everything but tried it on in the store and medium suited me just well sits above my hips and show s my shape very sexy warmer than my 200 north face go figure the only thing i don t like is the quarter inch strip of material that sits right along the zipper always get s caught i am so afraid i am going to rip it or break the teeth only flaw but still didn t stop me from buying 3 more can t beat the price so worth it i sadly had to return my ballet slipper pink because i ordered the wrong size i thought because the price was low it ran small not at all runs true to size if you are a m get a m i got a large now they are out well made for 19 00 a hood and pretty zipper looking for another color jacket has a metal zipper which i like but the interfacing is too wide and catches easily in the zipper no drawstring in the hood and the sleeves are a tad too long for my arms i like the weight of it for just a slip on to take a morning walk in arizona during our winter it should be good the fabric behind the zipper gets caught when you zip it it s not nearly as warm as a similarly priced puffer i got from penney s it looked nice might work for someone in a warmer climate not for michigan when the temp dipped into the low 50 s will be returning great puffer jacket bought this one and the rose gold color im 160 pds 5 5 the medium was a exact fit but in case i wear a sweater or thick s hirt under i bought the l and it was a little big but comfy really great price and light can pack really well it s super cute but not very warm at all i would have to seriously layer up to wear this as a full time winter coat really nice jacket i bought an 14 16 because i intended to wear over a hooded sweatshirt so i wanted it very roomy i normally would wear a 10 12 but it fits the way i wanted it too i love this jacket but i have a problem with the lining by the zipper continually getting stuck in the zipper other than that this is all i expected from this jacket warm light weight comfortable not bulky and fits good this coat is perfect it is warm but lightweight the hood is great to have as well it also has a biiltin pocket that you can turn the coat into yo make it packable and the price just a great coat for the price this white jacket looks very nice in the pictures but when you get it and put it on you can see all of the jacket filling and it looks terrible very disappointing,women's clothing,0

281,Woman Within Women's Plus Size Zip-Front Microfleece Jacket Fleece,30.92,0.0,2480.0,very comfortable warm jacket sweater great warmth for fall best for fall the cardinals on the jacket are not as nice as ad woman wirhin fleece nice jacket cardinal jacket not quite love it love it great fleece jacket i think you ll love it too great to snuggle into color of raspberry buffalo plaid not close to what is shown on website nice jacket fleece jacket very light weight jacket great jacket,i love this jacket sweater it keeps warm and toasty it s great over a t shirts for chilly mornings or evenings is also great for layering on the colder days in iowa it gets brutally cold in the winter i have worn this jacket as a coat over a camisole and lighter sweater and was fine going to and from the car or walking into work it really is very warm fits true to size not over bulky to where you feel like you re wearing a big winter coat but still has some weight to it sizing is larger than normal i did order the perfect size cuz i read a prior review that said that it is nice that it is long enough to actually cover perfect warm for fall weather i dislike the outrageous shipping of 16 99 it s crazy i received the product and i like it very much but i would like an adjustment for the shipping please nicely made size allows for t shirt to add warmth sleeves slightly long but ok fleese is very nice and soft washes well with no shrinkage expect at least two weeks for delivery if return expect to pay 8 50 for their mistake if exchanging the woman within company will probably take a month to get it back to you glad walmart is selling their products much easier to deal with order a size down as suggested runs really large the cardinals on the jacket are not as nice as shown in the picture at all i love cardinals but these are not exceptional i will say that usually the sleeves are not long from this company but these almost go to my wrist the fleece is quite thin more like a topper than a jacket i will use it but not as happy as i thought i would be note the walmart price is much cheaper than if you went online to thier site to buy very comfortable definitely oversized i like my clothes loose so ordered a 3x a 1xl would fit right i reordered a different color but sized down i will keep the bigger one for sledding days with the grandkids ordered the raspberry buffalo print it s pink and black not pink blue and purple like the picture shows but it s very pretty and very comfortable recommend checking size guide before ordering i m happy with the purchase the sizing is really different than other companies i did not have ready access to a size chart as i bought it through wal mart sold by woman within please provide a link to 3rd party size charts on clothing it was way too big i bought it a size smaller than i usually do and it s too big very thin warm but not heavy and bulky like most fleece outerwear love this jacket love this cozy zip up jacket it is lightweight but provides great warmth without being bulky i will definitely be ordering more since they are such a great value they are offered in a variety of colors and patterns and are the perfect length love it i was apprehensive about ordering a jacket online i m fussy about how things fit and selecting the correct size without trying on is always a bit risky but i read all the reviews and took everyone s comments into consideration and i m really pleased with my purchase i was concerned that it might run too short but the length is perfect just long enough to cover my butt sleeve length is also just right and the jacket is warm without being too warm perfect for spring and fall and even winter if you re just running out to get the mail i am a size 30 and ordered the 3x i love this jacket warm lightweight thank goodness the sleeves fit big enough around my plus size bicep perfect length i am 5 4 and hate when i have to roll up sleeves i first bought the black multi snowflake fun and loved it so much i got the navy great basic i live in them now back for more colors the challenge which color to choose next be aware if you wear this white jacket over a dark color there will be tiny bits of fluff left behind on whatever you have on under i do not know if a trip to the laundry will change this the sweater is very comfortable looks great and very welcome on a chili morning on the website the raspberry buffalo plaid is shown on multiple browsers as a deep pink with an indigo blue or even purple but what i got is a deep pinky red with black no hint of blue purple anywhere also the trim finishing along the bottom is shown as pink on the website but what i received has black trim returning disappointed i have three or four of the microfleece vests which i really like so wanted to try the long sleeved jacket it is so soft and comfy perfect for these fall nights or when riding in the car warmth without the bulk of a heavier coat they wash very well no shrinkage and come out of the drier ready to go for those who want something alittle warmer then a sweater but nicer then a sweatshirt this is it i thought it kept me warm enough for these cool fall days this jacket is true to size it is very light weight if you are like me i hate to wear long sleeves in the fall and this jacket is just right to throw on and go i bought the navy and the color is nice it comes with pockets and the length is good great jacket its perfect i ordered a size large the jacket runs a little large in women plus size the size was perfect i had a little extra room,women's clothing,0

the blue slightly darker in person but gorgeous cream and orange which is less vibrant than the picture but will be perfect for fall absolutely cannot go wrong with these for 12 buy them all i ordered an xl i could have ordered a l but i like some of my sweaters sweatshirts bigger to layer i mainly purchased this particular item because of the cotton blend too many clothing items are doing away with cotton and for me it adds weight comfort quality and durability when i do wash this top i will do so in cold water and hand dry unless i want to shrink it a bit n ndo not hesitate in purchasing this top it really is a great deal i bought these last winter and lived in them not as hot as sweats just cozy and very comfortable i think i have seven now was glad to see you had them again this year and i ordered early and the price cant nbe beat for the exceptional quality n nthank you these are highly valuable wardrobe staples they are soft and lightweight and the colors are beautiful and fun and look better in person the wine is a gorgeous mulberry and the corsair is a wonderful robins egg blue i also have the ivory which is a lovely cream color love this fabulous fit with the split hem and substantial cuffs makes it look way more expensive great find these sweatshirts are really nice the fabric is incredibly soft and they run true to size for an oversized fit that is not bulky they are a great dupe for the more expensive ones from aerie i want all of the colors highly recommend love the color length and style light weight sweater which is perfect for staying cozy in house on chilly days the material is soooo soft you will not be disappointed ive ordered two i ordered four of these sweatshirts in blue pink wine and black but wasn t quite sure about the fit i m so glad i decided to try them all on again with skinny jeans i m 5 8 140 pounds with long arms and torso the small is oversized perfection the soft high quality garment washed french terry fabric is just the right weight with a superb drape on my frame i love them so much i purchased four more today at my friendly neighborhood walmart and at this price why not bring on the cool weather love true to size but relaxed fit due to the dropped sleeves i got the teal color and it s actually really nice and rich even though the fabric has a lived in fade to it surprisingly thick fabric you d still want another layer underneath in true midwest winter and doesn t shrink appreciably in the wash i m looking forward to wearing this regularly this winter love the fit and comfort of this sweatshirt already bought two colors and wish to get more when restock wine color is very nice exactly like picture light and soft sweatshirt that is similar to aerie brand such nice color and i also bought another piece from time and tru sweatshirt in gem slate color both colors came out to be very similar one is more bluish than the other soft and comfortable sweater great color for fall and spring definitely oversized fit but cute in general colors are pretty runs a bit large but will liven up tights jeans medium light soft weight a shirt you will go to everyday the sleeves are long but push up to your desire i ordered 2 and planning to order more these tunic style soft generously sized crew sweat shirts are my fall and winter uniform of the day warm enough on their own or over a camisole as it gets colder they comfortably layer over a long sleeve tee shirt i like that this seasons sweat shirts are more colorful than previous seasons i hope to see these sweat shirts available again but in deep saturated jewel tones i had bought one of these at the walmart store it is perfect in the winter to wear around the house it keeps me warm without being too hot i really like the style of it so that is why i ordered another in a different color looks good with skinny jeans sweat pants and leggings i grabbed this at a local walmart when the weather turned unexpectedly chilly while at the beach i spent almost every evening cuddled on the porch wearing it now i wear it around the house constantly it s a super cozy modern version of a classic sweatshirt plus it s a great color love this purchase i bought this sweatshirt in a small and it felt very much oversized now if you like that then this is the sweat shirt for you but this looked like a tent on my small frame and it is something i would not wear out in public it was also not as soft as i would like but i wear a t shirt under my sweatshirts so that helps i love the time and tru women s crewneck sweatshirt ni bought one and liked it so well i wanted a couple more in different colors ni live in the 2nd largest city in our state and searched all of the 5 walmart s in my city but couldn t get all the colors i wanted so i ordered them ndelivery was quick with my order placed on saturday and all 4 received by wednesday ni now have the golden teal fuchsia light gray and plum a bonus is the boho leggings i found during my 3 store physical search before online search in a floral that match the golden perfectly nlet the cold weather lounging begin i first bought the wine color and loved wearing it so much that i bought every color i really like the hi low hem the relaxed fit which looks good with leggings and skinny jeans and the soft terry material that can be worn year round i also like that it s a modern version of classic sweatshirt and the colors are beautiful,women's clothing,1
283,Athletic Works Women's Athleisure Soft Joggers Sweatpants,12.96,4.7,430.0,very soft and comfortable so soft super comfy super soft cozy great joggers very soft comfy and true to size super soft jogger very comfy joggers warm and comfortable awesome joggers great sweats soft and warm lightweight and soft comfy comfy cute and a great fit navy blue great for everyday warm good quality comfortable and on trend,these joggers are very comfortable xa0 and so soft on the inside they are the perfect length im 5 6 and they are just xa0 at my ankles or over i guess to the top of my foot anyway they are mid rise so if you like your waist band higher they work that way easy just a bit above the ankle pulled up to your waist you can easily pull them up your leg as well to make them a capri style if you like they don t squeeze your calf when you do and hold shape the pockets are roomy and don t bulge out unless you are sitting but even then its not a big deal they fit close but not tight plenty of bending room and give they wash well i havent noticed any shrinkage i love these for lounging i honestly thought they would be tight and show everything lol but they are not and do not they are light but warm when its chilly and yet not hot on you when the temps are higher im in love with the fit and feel i recommend giving them a try these joggers are so soft and comfy the material is great i m 5 11 and i got the xxl for length but i didn t expect them to be so comfortable they are not heavy but they keep you warm the pockets are a plus for my phone the drawstring is also nice because it is actually soft material and not rope that unravels they wash up nice these are super comfy and they hold up really well they are excellent to work out and even just wear around the house the seams are stitched together real nice and the elastic waistband is comfortable all and all i really like these pants and plan to get more because comfort is just as important as looks athletic works soft jogger in black soot are the most comfortable pants i ve ever worn they are incredibly soft the jogger style is shorter and more form fitting through the calves they have pockets and a draw string i hope they come in more colors because i plan on getting them if so they re true to size you won t be sorry buying these i don t know yet if they will shrink in the wash but just to be safe i won t dry them in the dryer i will air dry i don t want to chance it these are a great product they are super soft and stretchy they have a band to help hold up the pants and suck in the waist they also have a tie on them to be able to loosen or tighten as needed they are almost silky feeling very stretchy and nylon texture i love them great for yoga or working out great product and great quality although they sent blue when i chose grey their still nice and soft havent tries them on yet but i know they will be trendy i will wear them as casual pants these athletic works soft joggers are just that so soft amd comfy inside and out these are definately true to size i picked out a medium which shows a 8 10 on the tag i am 5 ft 5 1 2 inches tall and weigh 136 lbs they fit perfect i never machine dry most of my clothes but i did these they barely shrank if at all these have nice pockets in the front the inside is a very soft short fleece the outside is very smooth and soft like a polyester cotton blend the tag does not state anything about the fabric the waist has a thick elastic high waist they have a functioning draw string as far as style the fit is very nice and complimenting as far as material for the fashionistas i would say this is around the house item they are so smooth looking they kind of look not so hip other than that these are fantastic as far as fit and comfort this review was provided as part of a promotion this pair is soft and super cozy the inside has a very soft lining that will be warm in winter i got a medium in the black and could of sized down to a small for sure the material is kind of shiny though not sure about that i know these will be great for running errands and just chill days at home i chose to review the athlete works soft joggers grey size large and for starters they are soft very large they are very comfy and the size is perfect not tight and not baggy just loose so that you can move around in these joggers are not heavy they are light and breathable too my intention for these are to lounge around in and to sleep in i ve washed them already and they have not attracted lint and have retained their softness and color i have also bought my teen a few pairs already the only thing that was work and i didn t like about the joggers where the color i chose grey but i received blue the pants are very warm and comfortable the pants should come in a variety of lengths because i am tall and these pants are short clothing companies do not believe people can be thin and tall they assume you are either fat and tall or short and thin the plus is they have pockets these are the softest pants i ever owned i absolutely love these they fit nice and are super stretchy however they don t stretch too much to creates baggy look on your knees and rear end i can wear them at home or make a quick trip to the grocery store they are true to size i ordered the size i usually wear and the pants fit perfectly what makes these pants super soft and stretchy is the fact that they are made 73 percent out of recycled polyester 22 percent modal and 5 percent spandex the only downside is that i ordered blue cove color but received black which is not a big deal i like these pants in black as well i haven t tried washing them yet but i am sure they will be fine and hopefully last me a long time i am planning on getting more pairs of these in the future very impressed with these sweatpants very well made nicely lined pockets is a great added feature i got these for my daughter and she just loves them these are my new favorite around the house and pajama pants they are super soft and are the perfect thickness to stay warm they wash easily did not shrink on cold cycle and have front pockets super happy with these i love the way these fit and feel also love that they are lightweight they are also true to size large women s fits 12 14 and that s my correct size i fit 12s i wore them yesterday and got complimented on them very pleased with these joggers these are great to just lounge around the house in or to run to the store and back they re super comfortable and soft i got a medium and they are true to size i mostly wear them at home because they re simple yet stylish i love that they re simple enough to rock with a plain t shirt of any color i also find them comfortable enough to actually jog in as well the simplicity comes in handy most when you have kids and a busy schedule you can just slip on a pair and keep going i love them i love these joggers they are so comfy the inside is fleece material and the outside is just so smooth i like the fit slim and not too baggy i bought 4 colors and i plan to wear them all of fall and winter i received the navy blue joggers they are very comfortable fit really well i wear a size 6 in jeans and the size small is a perfect fit i had selected the grey but the navy ones are just as great i like them for every day they are very comfortable and soft these joggers are great the are warm come in a lot of colors and are long enough for me i m 5 feet 10 and weigh 150 i could have gone with a small or a medium i chose medium because i wanted them to be a little slouchy it just depends on the look you want i bought 3 pair just purchased these joggers on a whim i was going for comfort alone and was amazed at how great they looked on these are not your typical sweats much cuter and on trend the fit is great and figure flattering i m 5 7 130lbs and the small fits perfect definitely recommend,women's clothing,1
284,Time and Tru Women's Stretch Knit Jeggings,12.96,4.3,3697.0,the best jegging i ever own you won t regret it they r like lays chips you cant stop at 1 color nice fit great price time great color not for big thigh hugely disappointed wrong size changed and not for the better different material not the same jeggings good quality runs big shouldn t have changed them don t buy these poorly made flimsy bad sizing short person approved granddaughter s christmas program embarrassment perfect fully love that actual color good,i bought 3 first after few days i order more bcz i love them looks so good on me i highly recommend this 100 i have yet to wear my pants yet but i can tell you they are very nice good quality pleasantly surprised i can not wait to wear them out with a nice sweater or dress them down with a nice white sweatshirt and platform converse time and tru should definitely repeat this style i love these jeggings they are super comfortable you dress them up with a blazer and boots or dress them down with a t shirt or tank top with sandals or tennis shoes these stretch jeans are actually a very decent quality and nicer than i expected i am 5 3 159lbs currently going down little by little thank you quarentine snacks lol the large fits nicely and won t be too big in the future i expect getting alot of wear from these very good value i bought the sea turtle green in store on clearance for 7 i washed and dried them and wore them yesterday they fit just right not tight nor loose and don t bag out or fall down very comfortable and soft i buy size xxl 20 and am normally size 18 20 i go between a l and xl they were on sale but they only had the l so i took a leap and bought them they re true to color i got the army green and the fabric is very soft and stretchy however if you got big booty thighs like i do they re a bit fit around the thighs they slide on and off but you should definitely go higher if you re l xl for these i have bought seven pairs of these pants and i ve had three of them rip in the exact same place two of them were the same color pants i bought on pair at the store i ordered four of the jeggins online because i ve used this brand and size for years now the new ones are way too tight even though they re the same size i always get the old ones still fit as always since i have not gained any wait in a long time they re just making them smaller i want to preface this by saying these used to be my go to pants for business casual attire during the workweek i have had a million pairs in the black and different color denim and loved them i would just replace them periodically because my thighs would rub holes and for the price that was fine for me they were not see through held everhthing in and were comfortable throughout quarantine i put on some weight i ran to walmart to buy these but could only find one pair in the next size so i immediately hopped on here and ordered three pairs the ones i purchased in store fit perfectly and were exactly the same as the old pairs the ones i got online the new version are horrible the material is wack they are less stretchy to begin with and as the day goes on they loosen up horribly i was horrified to go to the bathroom in the late afternoon and discover they had stretched out so far in the front that it looked like i had a bulge so i tried to pull them up and instead ended up with a front wedgie either way super unflattering and embarassing i had to go home on my lunch break and squeeze into my too tight ones and even then those looked better guess i will have to find a new go to pant unless they change it back ugh walmart fail if it ain t broke don t fix it i have worn an xl in these since they came out i missed the charcoal last year so was watching for them for fall and was so excited to find them on line these did not fit too small i then went and looked at the material and they have changed it these are also high waist which was ok but the size is off so go up a size i am very disappointed will order xxl and hope they fit very upset the first pair of black jeggings i had were very soft and fit perfect i ordered 2 more and they are a different stiffer material and they are way too small i would give 0 stars must return by the way these are all made in different countries if you read the inside tags and the fabric content varies why if these are all time and tru i got 3 pairs of these medium denim and black soot came in the mail today i ordered a size s which is a 4 6 but it s definitely more like a solid 6 i m a solid 4 and they are very big in the waist the legs are a bit loose as well but not too terribly i just exchanged for an xs which is crazy because i am not that small but i m hoping that the fit will be better n nquality wise they seem very great stretchy enough to be comfy thick enough to not easily tear or be see through i love the faux button it makes it possible to actually front tuck without looking like you have on fake jeans n nthe rise is high 12 according to my measure i m over 5 7 and it works for me but may be hard for short torso peeps to handle they are a little shorter than i prefer ankle ish length but for under 13 as long as the xs fit without having to constantly adjust them i ll wear the heck outta them this winter n ni will say the black ones run smaller than the medium denim by at least an inch or more in the waist i almost thought i should keep them but decided i d still prefer a snugger fit but if you re more of a 6 exactly you might want to size up on the black soot for whatever reason black denim and apparently even jeggings always runs much smaller weird if anyone knows the secret why share these are not the same time and tru jeggings sold in november 2019 i bought 4 pairs last year and absolutely loved them so i was restocking for this year just like jeans but with the stretch of a legging these new ones however was extremly disspointed with and returned them all yesterday they are pull on pants with the fake zipper button and pockets in front idk why they changed them i like the feel of wearing jeans that you zip and button and can put your hands in a pocket if you bought these 2019 beware they look the sane on the site but straight pull on pants time and tru i love all your items please go back to a real jean look with a legging feel thank you i have several pair of these i like them but these are slightly different than the ones previously purchased they changed the waist and now there is a large gap at the back of the waist band they were perfect before always remember don t fix it if it aint broken i was able to alter them but they were perfect before don t buy these terrible product cheesey flimsy material i already owned jeggings from this manufacturer but the sizing on the jeans on this order was really off i ordered a size larger than my usual size and these were smaller than the ones i have theses deserve more than five stars please time and true do not change anything about these jegging x80 x98s they are perfect and hug all the right places they are true to size first time trying them on i thought i ripped them but all is good lol im going to get more of theses good bye stiff jeans hello soft knit jeggings nhopefully my picture loads but i am 5 x80 x993 x80 x9d 156lbs wearing true size medium i have always bought pants jeggings at walmart never was a problem before but i ordered the time and tru this christmas and have wore the second time i had them on was very embarrassed when i got home from my granddaughter s christmas program defined that i had holes on the seam of the butt i m hoping the other pair doesn t do the same very disappointed i don t know what s changed i really miss the lei jeans that looked cute that walmart used to carry the seams breaking from ntop to bottom they are simply perf9 so exited is really good,women's clothing,0
285,Time and Tru Women's Plaid Button Front Shirt,9.5,4.5,194.0,throw it on top 10 10 would recommend darling fall wardrobe essential good shirt wonderful flannel shirts at a very great price comfy but big nice flannel shirt oh those sleeves my pet peeves short and wide shirt not soft and shrank a lot love the color wish it was more fitted definitely a to go shirt for the fall winter ok perfect shirt for fall comfortable shirt excellent runs big shrank a lot but only in certain areas nice shirts at an unbeatable price wardrobe must have,i dont know why i thought this would be a flat cotton non stretch top but its not its a brushed flannel on the thinner side but very nice layering well i d imagine i beleive it is a slight drop shoulder style there is no shaping seams on side of bust almost no stretch n ni think i ll size down or pass i feel the pit arms and chest are wide low n nshirt stats ntop mid shoulder seam to front botton hem 27 long back center 30 long nsleeve pit to cuff 19 narm width from pit 9 nchest across buttoned 25 1 2 ncollar side to shoulder 9 my actual 6 n this is why i say drop shoulder n nshoulder to shoulder 21 1 2 across front n my actual 16 1 2 the perfect fall autumn flannel great price great fit and beautiful colors 10 10 seriously this might be the cutest fall plaid i have ever seen it s a beautiful saffron yellow with burgundy red yellow i love this shirts it wonderful for a cool morning its a nice light weight flannel that will be perfect for our north florida climate in the winter it is very well made and the color is true to the picture the sizing for me is right on the mark i ordered the size large 12 14 and its perfect i also ordered the maroon and white and looks like i ll be wearing one of them today as our morning temp is 66 degrees very comfortable but it runs so big i should have went a size down and it would look nicer it had an awful smell when i opened the package almost like someone threw up on it im keeping it and hoping it will shrink after washing runs over size had to send back and order smaller size the colors were nice and bright the fabric is soft and fairly light weight cotton flannel it washed nicely and seems well made unfortunately the sleeves are very long and i will have to roll them up walmart should look through the photos of its tops and shirts and see how 5 10 models that are wearing size small have the sleeves down over their hands that means they re definitely going to be long for those of us that are more average shorter and wider the time and tru women s plaid button front shirt red and black runs wide and short for reference i am 5 9 and 155 lbs i am more narrow at shoulders and across bust but have wider hips and average length arms this top does have a longer back thank goodness however i wish the front was slightly longer it hits just at top of my jeans ni would not recommend this top for taller women unless super slender i didn t care for this one the flannel is on the thicker side and felt a little bit cardboard y i tried to wash it to soften it up but that made the shirt unwearable because the shrinkage esp the sleeve length was too much i hate when sleeves are too short it drives me crazy so this shirt was donated i enjoy the softness and warmth lightness of the shirt its a good transitional season type of shirt it does fit a bit baggy i am a bit more on the small petite side so the torso of the shirt could fit a bit closer but i do not mind all that much i do really enjoy the color combination on the shirt and have gotten many compliments on that aspect of it too 5 2 182lbs and the large fit was perfect although the sleeves a bit long on me the fit was roomy enough to go over a tank top dress yet not look boxy it is warm but not thick or scratchy this shirt is very soft and comfy however the fit is not quite right it has a short boxy fit i normally wear a medium so thats what i ordered but it s a short wide fit once its in i would have liked it to be more fitted what a beautiful color combination i received compliments on my first day wearing the shirt it s very comfortable it runs slightly bigger i normally wear large for other brands and medium suits me better i am 5 3 170lbs v cute but shrunk lot bought it oversized but it shrunk about 2 sizes in the 1st wash now its almost to small to wear probably needed to buy it 2 sizes bigger then what i wanted to keep it oversized this is a very comfortable shirt i bought a size large hoping it would shrink a bit but it didn t shrink i am 5ft and 134 lbs so i probably should have bought a med i wear a size 16 but so many reviews advised runs big i took a chance on l 12 14 and it fit perfectly shoulders back even sleeve length the fabric is flat and thinner than i expected but maybe it will fluff up after laundering i will wash and dry cold to try to protect the size i bought a red one and a green one and they re both great different shirt after washing before washing it was like a great old school oversized flannel loved those after washing the shirt is tight around the bust and upper arms shoulders the sleeves are too short bad and it s still huge around the belly the red in the black i bought 3 of these shirts and i really like them they are true to size and the material isn t heavy so you can layer underneath with tank top of you prefer they are perfect for cooler weather nice colors and you can t beat the price i washed them before wearing and they wash nice these fall cotton shirts are a must the size is right on colors are great material comfortable price is right and quality is way beyond price these shirts i now have collected all of the shirts for fall and winter wear and must for your wardrobe,women's clothing,0

287,C. Wonder Women’s T- Shirt With Gold Buttons,5.99,4.4,28.0,good quality shirt great quality shirt cute comfy short sleeve top beautiful looks good good product my go to crew neck pullover with buttons ss crew neck pullover with buttons crew neck pullover soft and comfortable ss crew neck pullover w buttons casual but classy looks good versatile great product nice top nice and casual buy not the best soft and comfortable,the color of this pullover is a very nice dark red the feel of the material is nice and soft the buttons on the shoulder are ok but doesn t seem to elevate the look to me i really like the ease of laundering the shirt i usually wear a medium but this is a small and fits perfectly if looking to update your shirts this wonder brand is something i would look for very nice crew neck pullover it is more than a t shirt it s dressy enough with the shoulder buttons that are gold and it really look good it even comes with an extra button great material not too thick and not too thin cannot see through the shirt i like the way it feels fits true to size very happy with my short sleeve crew neck pullover the three gold buttons on the one shoulder is just the right touch to make this top super cute the material is so comfy and doesn t cling to you there was no shrinkage or wrinkling when i washed it sizing is true to size one of the things i like about this shirt is the quality the quality gives you the opportunity to wear it with a jean jacket for a casual look or dress it up with dress pants and a sweater or all on it s own very happy with this top and that you can get so many different looks with it the shade of blue is absolutely beautiful the material is of thicker material so it s going to last forever it s not see through either i love it this shirt fits real well true to size color is bright and material is comfortable looks good with jeans or slacks highly recommend i like this style it is nice the shirt is a rich cobalt blue and made of soft material it is also true to size as well the only thing i do not like about it are the cheap gold shiny plastic buttons on the left shoulder so i just decided to cut them off the shirt would look so much better without them i now have a new bright red ss crew neck pullover shirt with gold button details the tag less trademark is located on the inside of the neck area it is a gold emblem with the word wonder on it this gold emblem is also found on the top of the 3 gold buttons on the left shoulder these details make the shirt pullover look dressy even though it is actually a comfortable casual shirt in my opinion the shirt is a cotton blend with modal material and a small percentage of spandex this shirt has a satin ribbon round strap inside each sleeve their purpose is secure the shirt on the clothes hanger so it will not slip off and fall on the floor i like this feature and quality clothes usually have these straps as well when i first touched the shirt it felt silky and it looked very lush i put it on and it fit well i knew right then that i liked it the color is a rich red which i could easily pair with a black gray navy or white sweater to wear for work or outings i didn t realize that the material modal absorbs dyes more readily than other materials it s because of this the shirt has that rich lush red coloring this modal material has less pilling than other fabrics it s machine washable on gentle cycle and dried with low heat you can also have it dry cleaned if you prefer to do so this ss crew neck pullover shirt is now an important go to essential part of my wardrobe it s comfortable looks luxurious if layered with other clothing items and jewelry the shirt with jeans or shorts also looks casual and relaxed it s up to you to decide how you want to wear this crew neck shirt by wonder i received my ss crew neck pullover with buttons its wonder brand which i ve never heard of and made in china i m very happy with the color this pullover has very pretty little buttons with the wonder brand insignia on them and they even included an extra one it sery pretty blue and it so soft it s 58 cotton 3 spandex and 39 modal which i had to look up because i didn t know what it was i was surprised to learn it s a super soft fiber from beech trees i found that very interesting this crew neck appears to be very well made as it is double sewn on the sleeves and bottom it seems to have a reinforced collar and had i m happy to say it had no hanging threads i think this crew neck pullover will last for years i would recommend this product if you want a nice well made and soft pullover this shirt fits and stretches it is a red color and comfortable it is the right length there are buttons on the shoulder for decoration this is pullover shirt i received this in good condition when i opened it the first thing that struck me was that it was soft and had a nice feel to it so naturally i went to the label to see the materials it stated 58 cotton 39 modal a type of rayon made from the fibers of the beech tree and3 spandex it looks nice but the collar area reminds me of a t shirt type collar in style it has 3 gold buttons attached to one shoulder it also comes with an extra button i got an x small and it was a bit small in the shoulder but not so much that i wouldn t wear it so i asked my neighbor to try it and it was too large on her it was also large around the waist and hung low we are both very short also i am a small person as is my neighbor so neither of us was 100 happy with the fit the material was very comfortable though i am sure that there are people that it would fit perfectly and they would probably love it the material is also very light weight i ve tried on this shirt and its comfortable to wear it stretches to fit my curves i would like this shirt even better if it had 3 4 sleeves to cover the upper part of my arms this shirt is a nice color as well the shirt fits very comfortably and it has a good stretch to it it s very simple yet the buttons on left hand side gives it a classy look you can wear it with some jeans for a casual look or even with some dress pants this is my review on the ss crew neck pullover w buttons shirt this is a pretty royal blue colored shirt and it is a very soft shirt i like the material on this shirt and it is definitely a small like it is supposed to be but it is more of a small petite i would say because it is shorter than just a regular small would be it has these three little gold buttons on the shoulder and i think they are a bit cheap looking and it would be better without them the seams are well put together and do not seem to be giving and this shirt has no stretch to it product received free in exchange for honest and unbiased review this is an absolutely and versatilewardrobe addition i got the royal blue shirt with gold buttons across the shoulders the material is a little stretchy and thinner making it perfect for warmer weather when worn with a lightweight jacket it could also be worn during cooler months layered with another shirt or blouse it would be appropriate for an informal event or office wear washes and dries beautifully sizing is fairly true and accurate this is my review on the keurig k duo essentials coffee maker with single serve k cup pod and 12 cup carafe brewer black introducing the k duo essentials single serve carafe coffee maker this is the perfect brewer for any occasion and is the best for using both k cup pods and ground coffee to brew a cup of coffee the machine holds 60 oz of water and it is for both makers to share i m not sure if you can use the keurig k cup brewer and the coffee pot brewer at the same time since they both use the same tank you can have your perfect cup and carafe every time with the k duo essentials coffee maker with multiple brew sizes you can make an 8 10 or 12 cup carafe for your favorite cup size this is perfect for me and my husband because i like the french vanilla k cups and he likes strong black coffee we have both at the same time i like to limit myself to about 8ozs of coffee a day so i just make my one cup and that s all i have for the day this is the best appliance ever and makes really hot coffee or just hot water for hot chocolate i received this item for the purpose of review this beautiful rich tomato red top arrived wrapped in white tissue paper what a nice change from cello bags it s beautiful only size selection was xs so it fits my daughter she loves it and can wear it as a base layer under her leather blazer or alone in warmer weather very pretty very well made beautiful color i recommend thanks walmart this shirt is soft and made of great material there are straps inside the collar for hanging i haven t washed it yet but being half cotton it shouldn t shrink and fits just as expected there are buttons on the shoulder which are gold and add a nice to it my favorite color red the buttons say style this is just your average crewshirt don t find anything special about it the material is very cheap and it wears pretty baggy even though it s a good fit feels cheap looks cheap wears cheap overall i would not buy one this crew neck pullover with buttons is very comfortable soft and attractive the buttons on the shoulder give it a special accent that dresses it up it is perfect for a casual luncheon or dinner i have had compliments when i go to with friends,women's clothing,1
288,C. Wonder Women's Long Sleeve Printed Midi Wrap Dress,35.99,3.8,18.0,so cute midi wrap dress pretty dress love it really nice dress wrap dress a beautiful dress lucky i m skinny decent dress runs a little big paper thin cute but makes me look bigger than i am long sleeve midi wrap dress lesson only buy thing if i can try them on first not worth it was cute but way too big,this dress us so cute breezy material faux wrap with two large gild buttons under bust bi level faux wrap tulip skirt midi length with 3 4 sleeves navy blue background with white interlocking print love i received the c wonder long sleeve printed midi wrap dress in a dark blue and white pattern it s made of polyester and has a silky feeling i got it in xl size and it fits perfectly so it seems to be true to size it s a wrap dress and it wraps around far enough that it s not revealing it also comes with an extra button it s machine washable and can be dried didn t have any issues with shrinkage very nice dress i usually wear a size small in ladies and a medium in juniors this dress is cut like a juniors dress it fits me perfectly on top but is a little small in the waist however if i were a juniors small this dress would fit perfectly or if i lost a few pounds this dress would fit perfectly that aside this is a really nice dress with a flattering fit the material is light and lends itself to spring summer or fall wear i could probably even wear this dress with leggings and a sweater in winter i could see myself wearing this to work or dressing it up and wearing it to a special event this dress looks expensive like one you would find at a high end retailer i m sure i ll get a lot of use out of it the material flows nicely but is not stretchy or giving so be sure to order according to your size i love the wrap style with buttons to hold the wrap in place the down side to that is the top opens when i move but this can be easily rectified with a pin or a cami underneath i do not know what this dress cost because i received this dress in exchange for an honest review i am an hourglass figure and usually wear a small in ladies dresses i have a short torso and my measurements are 35 30 38 i ordered this dress in a size small i didn t expect it to fit as nicely as it does this dress fits more like a juniors size which is better for me i am thankful that the waist it sits at my natural waist and not lower the only thing i don t love about the dress is that the top opens a little when i move most wrap dresses do but i ll just use a pin to keep it closed or sew in a little snap so that it doesn t open the bottom of the dress is full cut and flows nicely this is a great dress for the office church or a party i look forward to wearing it in the spring or fall i also love that it is longer in the back and shorter in the front i think it adds an interesting flair to the dress the label says machine wash and tumble dry i haven t washed it yet so i can t speak to how it will hold up over time but it looks like it s good quality and well made i have no idea of the price of this dress as i received it in return for an honest review however i would expect to pay around 50 60 the pattern and color of the dress are so pretty classic navy and white patterned wrap dress with gold button accents the material is really soft and sleek almost feels like linen but no wrinkles it is so well made and drapes beautifully this dress is absolutely perfect fits length and hips the sleeves are not to tight and the waist line fits perfectly it is very hard to find a dress that fits not only a slim person but a plus size person also highly recommend this dress it s also a great gift to give the only size available for review was an xs and thank goodness i m in a skinny phase at this time i got a million compliments on my look that day sadly no pictures but pairing a simple set of faux pearl strand and earrings complemented it perfectly can be worn with heels and a suit jacket for business or simple flats for a breezy and pretty feel not long sleeved more of a 3 4 but not annoying in the least this will be my go to dress for many events the design and quality of this wrap dress is nice however it does run a little big i am usually a medium and i felt a little weighed down by this trip it is a nice dress for work or a semi formal event would size down if between sizes this dress is cheap poorly made see through thin like paper and runs small it s 100 ployester it s a long dress definitely not for winter weather extremely surprised on how cheaply this dress is i really like the dress and the print however the way the dress is made makes me look bigger in the mid section of my body i wanted to love it but something about the design isn t right i do not like this dress it is ugly i do not like the fit or the way it is made it is cut too low in front for me if i ever wear it i would have to put another dress under it dress fits well just not flattering to my body type i looks awful on me in my opinion stiff and rough material button fell of as soon as i opened the package im 5 7 170 and bought the large it was huge on me so i returned it the fit of this dress is terrible i ll be returning it,women's clothing,0

290,Blissful Benefits by Warner's® Women's Easy Size Underarm Smoothing Seamless Wire-Free Bra,10.46,4.7,526.0,great bra happiness as a woman comfy just a little snug i want more for me best fitting wireless bra everything you want or need in a bra comforable and supportive my wal mart purchase not happy wrong color x two love these black bra fit right out of the bag and very comfy very comfortable bra love this bra and the price most comfortable bra i have had on in years best bra ever size up great product didn t fit well under the arm area too high wonderful comfortable bra,of the three blissful benefits styles i tried this was my favorite it s lightweight incredibly comfortable and doesn t shift during movement so you don t have to tug the straps or band back into place i m a 34d and the medium was a perfect fit highly recommend i absolutely love this bra it s so comfortable it s perfectly sized for my shape and keeps things where they belong as i haven t found in many years i m very happy with how well this bra is lifting shaping and controlling my shape i would give this bra ten stars if i could i decided years ago that underwire bras do not work for me this bra has no wiring just tons of support very comfortable and soft followed the size guide listed in bra tag but recommend size was a little smaller than i like the next size up was too big so i kept the smaller and used an expander to give me the extra room i needed worked perfectly i bought two of these bras i bought the almond colored one and this black one the bras are lightly padded to give support and the underarm support is amazing the size is perfect the support is perfect the coloring is perfect and i will be buying more of these bras in the near future this bra is one of the most comfortable bras i have owned in a long time i got sick of the wires poking getting bent making marks but i was scared that wireless won t give enough support i ve researched bras for a long time and i can t afford to be spending 20 even 30 for a bra i don t see any need for it because it s not much material so bras are a big rip off well the first foremost thing for me is the padding is just enough padding that nothing pokes through next is the support for me there s enough support the band stretches so there s no tightness and no marks the straps are easily adjustable there s enough coverage i wear sports bras often and in this heat it gets mighty hot because they get squished together so i have to put a lot of baby powder there but with this bra i don t have to put so much baby powder to keep dry because this bra still separates i will never go back two wires again it is sad how bras are expensive with as little material as they are and their mass produced so it really doesn t cost anything to make them i hope the broads will last quite a while i believe it should they should especially since i wash them and one of those little zipper bags and i let them air dry so i think walmart for carrying these bras at a decent price i do wish they came in more colors i am a breast cancer survivor with 2 different size cups bras that fit are hard to find what a nice surprise to get everything i needed in a bra that fits looks nice comfortable these are the most comfortable and supportive i have ever worn i am so thankful someone recommended them to me nearly a year ago i need the wider sides but just the 2 snap is fine and these are perfect while shopping with my sister she showed these bras to me and said it was most comfortable you should try it i did and omg comfortable yes indeed no under wire to dig in nice fit store did not have my size in stock only smaller sizes imagine that so i checked on line shipping was a day earlier than expected thank you wal mart i would like the bra very much if it fit i wear a 2x and have to use an extender so i tried a 3x and it only added an inch to the bra still would have to use an extender i haven t had this kind of problem with other bras i ve bought wont buy another 2 times i was sent the wrong color i now have 2 black bras instead of the 2 blue ones i ordered getting hold of someone online is impossible beware of the color apparently tempest is black but online its blue great fit soft and comfortable the wide straps are comfortable and the high underarm sides keep the underarm area smooth and comfy love love love this bra is wonderful the sides not riding down is a plus the sides stay up and feel great soft cups are a beauty love these bras i can t stand to wear underwire anymore so i replaced them with these so very comfortable i love this bra i ve had gastric bypass and the girls went away this bra lifts and has soft padding just enough to cover nipples very soft and light i am a 42 and i use the loosest hooks such a comfortable fit also gives a shape without looking pointy extremely comfortable covers the slight bulge that bra straps usually create near the underarm i love this bra and i will be buying another very nice cup not too bulky or thick with unneccesary padding which i can t stand perfect fit for me size 16 buy it these bras that i have bought on here are the most comfortable bra that i have worn in years i can t wear the underwire in bras and thanks to the employee that just happen to pick this bra out for me and the only one left and in size 3xl i thought to myself and said well it should fit and i m glad i grabbed it because they don t have it in the stores now so i looked here online and ordered 4 different colors they are my new favorite bra great bra washes well too i got an x large but i wish i would have sized up the x large feels like a size large maybe its just me as i like my bras to be not to snug i was a little apprehensive about ordering a bra online but i decided to after reading so many good reviews i couldn t be happier the fit is perfect and it is very comfortable i initially ordered two but after i received them i ordered four more i ve worn it once washed pleased with how it came out the only issue i had was the sides are so high up under the arms it was uncomfortable i started to wear it a second time and decided i didn t feel like being uncomfortable all day not happy with purchase it didn t ride up which was a plus it was just the sides were way too high under the arm when in the store the bras were listed by 38b etc online it was like s m l confused on what size to purchase online,women's clothing,0
291,Lee Riders Women's Classic Fit Jean,17.26,4.2,1258.0,i love these lee riders women s classic fit jeans lee riders classic fit jeans i am satisfied my fav summer jeans not quite as pictured but ok inseam is a full inch shorter than previously faded jeans not liking the 2 pair i got not a happy buyer sizing is not correct size not labeled correctly jeans too much stretch and front pockets too short just as advertised ok for now but like old style better perfect for older women at last a fit i m comfortable with i like the new black jeans slim thigh not for me,i really do love these lee riders women s classic fit jeans these are the only ones i ve worn since the first pair i wore i always have four pair on hand mainly because they are so hard to find this past year i waited for these to come back for over a year please keep them in stock i won t wear jeans that do not fit at the waist and i am finding that placement is harder to find these days i m not built to have my jeans at mid or low rise these lee riders have some stretch and that also is to my liking i plan on ordering several more pairs for winter i stand at 160 lbs and the 14p fits perfectly i am well pleased with my jeans i gain weight i didn t know what size to order but the ones i ordered are great without worrying about how they would fix thank you and for the other items i ordered and i am satisfied daisy julian 11 06 2020 i love these light weight jeans for hot weather wear super for gardening etc i have 3 pairs that are 7 years old and starting to tip at the knees these are to replace those good jeans actually sit up on your waist older ladies really don t look right in skinny jeans or hip huggers these jeans fit like old school medium weight denim not too warm not too hot only downside is they still have that halfworn look about them not a deep dark finish like pictured i ve always really liked the straight leg classic fit riders by lee and have worn them for years size 6m but my big complaint with my recent purchase is regarding the inseam length the classic fit straight leg riders i purchased maybe 4 5 years ago finally wore out and i needed to buy new ones so i ordered them 3 pairs not being able to find them in a store anywhere i was extremely disappointed to find that this supposedly exact same jean and exact same size is now a solid inch shorter in the inseam than the ones i bought a few years back plus the cotton content is now higher 81 than the older ones 74 so when washed that inch shorter became more than an inch i m 62 and not exactly getting taller just the opposite i can t wear them with any kind of heel and they re almost too short for even a flat shoe i really like this jean but why in the world was the inseam changed i think a 6l will be too long thus my 3 star rating very disappointed i was disappointed in this pair of jeans the last pair i bought and the photo on the website were solid dark blue i had been looking everywhere for a pair that were not pre faded as i would like them to look nice for a while before they become gardening jeans i was excited to find them on the website thinking i had found the original basic jeans without the fashion fading these arrived with a very distinctive and unflattering faded pattern that makes it look as though the crotch area is actually wet because it is sooo much darker than the thighs i really wish lee would still offer one color jeans i have several pairs of these jeans as i like them really well sooo i ordered more and the 2 pair i got seemed like they ride lower on the hips and i am always pulling them up i dont care for that purchased on reviews of so many but they are poorly made very shallow pockets and do not fit the way jeans are supposed to for an older lady even though i ordered petite the legs are way too long and need to be shortened i will be returning them as soon as the store takes returns very upset with this purchase i have been wearing these jeans for many years in a size 10 the last two pairs i ordered were both incorrectly labeled or the sizing has drastically changed because they fit like a six or an eight so i returned them my weight hasn t changed in years these jeans are great but the size is not labeled correctly the tag inside says 18p i ordered an 18 p in black and blue the blue fits perfectly but the black ones are way too long and i can t come close to buttoning them i think they are actually 16l these say there the same pant but they are a little longer than the last ones i ordered and taller at waist as well not enough for me to not like them but they are slightly uncomfortable they are a lot thinner as well they do not feel as sturdy over all i do like them i wish they would make these jeans the way they used to make them namely with the longer front pockets and without the high elastic content they are okay but preferred the previous fabric and pocket style the only thing i disliked was the way they fit i am losing weight so i had to go with my size because the bigger size is too big but they were tight in the stomach area and they were tight all day fast shipping fit great no color fade i washed three times no shrinking from dryer front pockets could be deeper but the back ones fine to put my phone in i do not really care for the color or the feel of the fabric of these jeans i like my rider jeans from several years ago better but they are worn out and i needed new ones i tried five times in store to find a pair i liked with no luck i would get the fabric and or color only to realize i could not get them over my thighs or it would show too much of my butt even though they were supposed to be my size the jeans i purchased are comfortable and fit well without showing what i don t want out there get rid of the words skinny flare leg and low rise and make jeans for active 40ish women who want comfort to go with quality in colors that look nice i would be much happier with my wardrobe i have been wearing this style jean for years it is a classic at the waist jean when i finally found jeans without bling on the butt or hip hugger style that fit i bought several pair i had bought this style in the store and then the store no longer carried them i found the style number online and ordered several pair this time the style changed slightly even though the style numbers remained the same the fabric has a little more stretch than before and the cut is slightly larger i ordered my regular size and returned them for a smaller size these do not have the leather lee label on the waistband the fabric is a firm medium weight and the color is even no bleached out look they are comfortable and look good with a blazer or sweatshirt i ve been hunting for jeans for months as i had outgrown my last pairs i m old enough not to want low or mid rise jeans anymore but not about to give in to fully elastic waistbands just yet i m sure that will come sooner or later i m 5 8 and recently reached 162 lbs i blame being 54 years old for this after trying size 14 too tight skipping rite up to size 18 too loose i tried different manufacturers in size 16 the classic fit and the waist height rise are exactly what i ve been looking for helps hold in my tummy without cutting off my circulation at the waist the legs are just loose enough that i can move around but not so loose that they look sloppy they re just a touch long even on my long legs but one wash brings them to just the right length these are terrific and i now have purchased 3 pairs exactly the same i m very pleased with these jeans i know lots of reviews have said they don t like the new material used in making the black lee jeans but i like it it has enough stretch to hug me but still looks great i love the fit of the relaxed fit the higher waist it gives me a waist line again thank you lee jeans for bringing back a classic look my husband said my butt looks great in these jeans i will be sure to purchase more i would love to see this style and fit in some bright colors since that is the style now thanks again lee jeans the manufacturer tag indicates that these are slimmer through the hip thigh if the online description had included that information i could have saved myself a return if you have curvy muscular thighs this is probably not the style for you ni did like the dark denim color and the embroidery on the pockets is not over the top like some would have kept if the style had standard fit thighs nnote this is the thin stretchy denim if you are looking for the thick less stretchy denim look at the core styles nit would be helpful if the online descriptions included the label information regarding rise and hip thigh fits,women's clothing,0

enjoy omg i m soooo glad that i order these pajamas and i m soooo glad that i got the right size so i didn t have to send them back hehe but for real tho these are just what i was looking for i was looking for something warm i love this pair of cotton flannel pajamas i waited for them to arrive to check the quality and size before ordering more i found them to be the perfect medium weight of fabric for warmth and the perfect size i wear size large i am short so the sleeves and pants are long but that is to be expected when i can t find pj s or other apparel in petite sizes i can hem the pants and fold up the sleeves one time the only disappointment is that i ordered the other 2 pairs only two days after the first pair and the price increased by 3 00 on each pair great flannel pajamas great quality flannel at very reasonable price priced flannel pjs on many other sites and price was usually almost double size is true fit washed before wearing and no shrinkage highly recommend if you need flannel pjs also love the red bird pattern highly recommended made of 100 cotton which is exactly what i m looking for excellent quality i ve bought many pajamas over the years for myself and family memebers from costco and none of them can beat this one in every aspect what i like the most is that it s not saggy like others this is the best pajama i ve ever had size runs small compared to those sold in costco or other stores will need to request for exchange soft and true to size my mil loves it we got it because she is always cold and this is keeping her nice and warm all night long she is short so i did have to hem both sleeves and pants i wear them on my balcony overlooking the atlantic oceanat night during cold breezes they are warm beautiful great fit washes well on gentle my neighbors like them too pj s were cute top too small for a size m npants too long and narrow for my legs label said made in vietman vietmans ladies are smaller than america size women gave them away too much hassle to return can t take back to store no computer to print return these are really nice and very bright and pretty i m a size 16 i m 5 6 i went with an xl and these are too large i love them though so i ll reorder a size l sent the wrong size and then expected me to print out a shipping lable to return merchandise that i didnt order back to sender this was a gift to my mother in kokomo in and i live in chicago my mom doesnt have a computer i wont be ordering from this company again once bitten i liked the quality but i bought a size medium to make sure the pajamas would be comfortable and not shrink i usually buy a small but the medium runs small in my opinion perhaps i should have bought a large however they are pretty so buy larger size if youre bigger than 4 6 was a gift for mom who is hard to please when buying clothes for she loves them she said that they are comfy warm and truly worth double the price these pajamas are soft material i got a size xl because i usually buy l but these were more of a large than an xl i should have got a xxl because i like to where lose pajamas well made with top quality fabric so soft wash and dry with no shrinklage i bought two sets cupcakes and polarbear both are exact size love the extra buttons that most do not have no twisting on waistband these pajamas are beautiful soft and warm i love them the colors are bright and the fabric is great quality they will be perfect for these cold fall winter nights that are coming i m going to buy a couple more pair in other colors love the color feel nice and cozy well made

out of the dryer and did not need any ironing i tested this 100 polyester blouse from c wonder i picked a large i love the colors and the pattern this is a button up 3 4 sleeve the tie cuff is so cute on the sleeves the arms are ok for me but do fit tight if you have large upper arms the shirt arms may not fit properly it is oversized in the body and hangs from the armpit 18 inches in the front and 23 inches in the back this length covers the body nicely i am not sure what the over sized means in the description does it mean extra wide or extra long i just wish the arm width matched the shirt width this shirt hangs so nice and feels very silky all the stitching is done very nicely so should hold up well there are eight pretty blue buttons down the front but there is no extra button sewn on the inside the material is not see through at all so can be worn without worry it looks great worn under long cardigans or sweaters this blouse would have been perfect if the arm width had been a little more generous care says to wash cool and dry on low this shirt is nice and long it is an attractive blue and white print the material is 100 polyester and is pretty thin but not see through the good part is it s genuine wash and wear when washed in cool water on gentle cycle and dried on low it does not shrink and does not need ironing yay the 3 4 sleeves have ties that you can just tie with a large loose knot it runs a little small i ordered my regular size xl and it s a little snug in the upper arm shoulder area but not so tight that i can t wear it it fits okay other than that the material is thin so the shirt is best suited for wearing in warm weather not the middle of winter it goes well with jeans or slacks and is long enough to cover your derriere the shirt is great for casual wear or to the office i received the shirt from the order from a mark up photo photo the sketch looks amazing the shirt in person it s ok it s very light weight so you can wear it during the spring or the summer time even with there being three quarter sleeves the blue and the paisley print are beautiful however in the mock photo the paisley print looks larger the cut of this shirt looks slightly different also from the mock photo this shirt fits true to size i received an extra large the quality of the shirt is as expected like i said just a little thinner than i thought it would be

less to see my full review check out my youtube channel or instagram lifeinstylebyliz the c wonder long sleeve self tie wrap dress from spark review has arrived and i love it the c wonder long sleeve self tie wrap color name is kissing logo fuschia red this c wonder dress has 2 purposes it makes a comfortable work dress or i can add a necklace and i m ready for an evening out the dress wraps from the front with a long self tie the dress is 1oo polyester the dress cleans in cool water this dress is comfortable and soft i would recommend this dress to my friends when i saw this dress i knew i had to have the chance to test it i have a small tall very thin daughter in law that never finds a dress this dress is so beautiful in design the gold chain design with emerald green background it is a nice wrap around and with the long sleeves and low neck line so very pretty you can fold it and days later no fold lines and it is a nice heavy silky material this dress is absolutely beautiful and great for packing i cannot say enough about this dress just love it i love the c wonder long sleeve self tie wrap dress it has a silky feel to it and the polyester fabric has enough weight to it that it hangs nicely it is thick enough that i don t feel the need to wear a slip if i don t want to it is also easy to put on because it opens completely up in the front then i just pull the long fabric belt into the loop to wrap around no messing up my hair or make up putting it on or worrying about how i am going to get a zipper up i am a petite size 5 3 and this dress is not a petite so the sleeves were a little long on me however because it has the stretchy fabric i was able to slide the sleeves up to just below my elbows which i prefer to do anyway and they stayed there i feel i can wear this dress for casual or for dressy and the best part is that it can go in the wash with all my other tops and dark colors in the dryer tumble on low too the green color with the gold chain print is eye catching and to me gives me a dressy vibe i also like that the wrap top can cover my chest area to the degree that i prefer another thing i noticed is that this dress is completely adjustable for weight gain or loss so if i gain 10 lbs i would still be able to wear this dress i hope to find one in another color too i feel comfortable in it and that is the biggest reason i would continue to wear this dress recommend it to others there is so much to love about this c wonder long sleeve wrap dress the color is so rich and looks expensive and feels luxurious this is a true wrap top and is very flattering to the figure i really like the self closure too the 100 polyester jersey is perfect for work or travel dress it up or dress it down it s so comfortable you can wear it all day and into the evening great for travel because it will come out of the suitcase ready to go mine is a small petite and the shoulder is a bit large and the arms are a little long for me but overall the fit is great the c wonder long sleeve self tie wrap dress is a must have for any wardrobe i know i will wear this over and over i received the c wonder log sleeved tie wrap dress and i love it the jersey material fit my shape perfectly i love how the material seemed to effortless fit my body type and not bulge or gather as i walked in the dress i was also impressed with the color that the dress came in the dress was a nice dark green with very light and delicate designs the green really pops and it works with all my summertime sandals the green is also versatile so i can coordinate it with different purses and shoes easily i also like the fact the dress comes down to my knees and i can easily wear it to work with no distractions finding options that i can use for work and use for nighttime are very important to me i like that i can go from work to nighttime events without having to change outfits the dress is comfortable and stylish and i am beyond happy with my choice i like how the fabric feels and i like the movement of the dress i would invest in another dress of this type the wrap around dress is almost a must and very flattering this is a beautiful dress i really enjoy wearing it the fit and style are perfect the pattern is in the pink fushia and white color family very feminine it has a really pretty pattern it is long sleeved which means it can be worn in any season i love a long sleeve dress to wear in air conditioning i also like a long sleeve to cover and conceal my arms it is a wrap dress which is flattering as it can easily adapt to different shapes and various waist lines this material is soft and does not need to be ironed i don t hang it in my closet i just fold it and keep it in my drawer and take it out when ready to use i feel good wearing it and it is also very comfortable i recommend this beautiful dress it is attractive and flattering i love the c wonder long sleeve self wrap dress it is so comfortable i love that it is made of a heavy weight polyester and spandex material i love the vibrant magenta color of this dress as well as the patterned print this dress does run a little big i would suggest that customers purchase 1 size down to have a perfect fit i would definitely recommend this dress to others there is so much i love about this c wonder long sleeve self tie wrap dress love the print and color design the color is rich and looks so expensive the dress is 100 polyester jersey and is perfect for day or evening dress it up or down and so comfortable also machine washable is always a good thing it s super soft and feels very luxurious this is a true wrap top and is very flattering to the figure my dress is a small petite but the shoulders and arms are bit big long for me it hangs a little on me overall i do love the dress but will have to roll the sleeve up to wear this dress would be a great travel dress it will come out of your suitcase looking great and you can wear it anywhere or for any occasion work or play this dress is a nice quality jersey very soft and with enough weight to hang very nicely it is well made i am 5 4 and it hits just below the knee a nice length the self fabric tie is just the right length as well this is a bright pink with a white pattern pretty color it can be worn anywhere dressed up with jewelry or for a casual day of shopping in flats the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the sizing it runs a bit small i would say the medium is about a size 8 i am a 10 so it is too small for me that said it is lovely and i would highly recommend it the material is soft and stretchy i ordered a small size and it was a bit tight for me however i was able to wear a blouse under and it fit well the colors are also bright and it s a nice summer wear have to return this purchase like the look though it s too low cut to wear to work also the sash is heavy and slides down too much work i was not very impressed by this dress the only thing that held it together was the tie it would have been nice if there was a clasp or something else to help keep the dress tied also i was not fond of the materials it was a heavy dress i wanted to like this dress and i tried very hard to like it it was ill fitting on my body type smaller chest i considered keeping it for a nightgown lounge dress but decided against it i love the wrap style of this dress as it is very flattering for almost all body types the material that the dress is made of is also very soft and doesn t wrinkle which makes it really great for travel the only thing i would add is the fit is a little small so if you have a larger chest size you may need to size up i like the fit of this dress wrap dresses fit most any body type i like the color green print not to short could use a bit more coverage up top need to wear a tee shirt underneath good price great for work an evening out with friends or a date night true to size i chose small petite being 5 feet tall regular size even in small is not enough happy to size the dress fits my petite frame perfect length in sleeves and dress length still a little long but slight the color is bright bold the print is beautiful very nice quality not cheap fabric or thin or see through i love the wrap dress and nice touch for the belt loops that are wide loops for better appearance better fit the fabric has a more silky feel i do love the inside wrap has a fasten for a more secure fit beautiful dress sexy can be worn for the professional office or a nice after work dress out too light weight easy to put on wrap dress dress is form fitting and fits as expected very flattering for my shape looking forward to wear this in the spring time as it is a nice pink color fabric is very comfortable unsure of durability as i have only washed it once but do hang dry to not ruin fabric looking forward to purchase more from this brand i wear a size 18 and i ordered a size xl green print and it fits great i am 5 6 and it fall just below the knee the wrap dresses fits more all body types and i carry my weight in my stomach and this dress covers it my only complaint is that it i will have to wear a tee shirt underneath not enough coverage up top great dress for work an evening out with friends or date night i really like this dress good price too great color nice fit not too short good price great work outfit wear it to the job and everyone loved it i would wear a tee shirt up top for me it was not enough coverage machine wash in cold water no bleach and tumble dry no ironing needed if you remove the immediately,women's

303,C. Wonder Women's Color Block Cardigan,9.99,4.1,10.0,easy care very comfortable cardigan great quality would give more stars nice jacket amazing sweater jacket block cardigan not as expected not for me,this cardigan is more than i expected it is comfortable and soft to the touch the color goes very well together and fits well one thing that i noticed is that the sizing is not quite right i received a xsmall and tried it on and it fits like a large if someone is really petite it will be too large for them but other than that i really like this cardigan the color and the fit the design of the cardigan is great and it is button free my key benefits of the cardigan is that is a really warm material that s just right not too light and not to heavy another thing the quality is excellent wonderful material easy to care for i can t wait to wear this cardigan out to a get together the c wonder cardigan is really a nice looking fit for my wardrobe i love the navy blue color with the red trim it s great the cardigan is knit so it makes for a great comfortable feel this c wonder cardigan would look great over pants a skirt or even a pretty dress there are so many ways you could mix and match with this cardigan if you get a chance to purchase this cardigan i am sure you will love the way it looks and feels pleasantly surprised this cardigan is thick and very dressy the colors are bold and i love the material the quality is fantastic it does run big so i would size down 1 2 sizes depending on how you like the fit of a long cardigan this cardigan is a navy body color with red trim around the neck and down the front i was so surprised how soft and the great feel of the material of which this cardigan is made the length of the cardigan is just at my fingertips and i find it to be correct this cardigan is lightweight and will be surprised at the warmth of this garment i have a cat and some material is almost a magnet to cat hair but this cardigan is not like that i have washed it on gentle setting and it has not faded or lost color holds its shape and have not used the dryer i lay it flat and it dries quickly and it is light weight i was concerned that the red stripe would not allow it to go with but a few garments i have worn it with many types of clothing and it always looks nice i found this to be accurate with the sizing and the sleeves are long enough for me i do have long arms fits great this navy blue color block cardigan with the red border on it is so comfortable it s lightweight and well designed this is one of those little jackets you can wear with anything jeans dress pants over a dress and it will look great love the way it looks and feels definitely recommend it what a nice sweater this cardigan is much heavier in weight than i expected it is a very fine weave and smooth to the touch the striking bold colors of red and navy blue really catch the eye and the length is good for covering the hips and such it has two large pockets it did not wrinkle when i wore it the sweater continued to look new and fresh all day i paired it with light grey slacks and matching top and it looked stunning white will also be beautiful i really like this sweater i would recommend this product because it is a very nice jacket i love the pockets it is fitted on the larger size where i usually wear a large or extra large i could wear a medium in this jacket although this cardigan is nice and warm a good length and pretty colored all of that cannot make up for the itchy material this material needs softened a bit as it irritates my skin polyester does that to me as well if you wear something underneath it that covers all the places it will touch it might be ok to sensitive skin but short sleeves would be out for me sorry the wonder color block cardigan is not what i excepted it to be as a cardigan i thought it would be a sweater material this is a heavy knit material that someone may like but it s not my style it is a nice long jacket type that is well made and would look nice with a pair of slacks and some red accessories to match i personally would not recommend this product the material was not sweater but a heavy polyester no buttons opened in front to just hang open the color blocking was okay i don t usually do disappointing reviews but i was disappointed with the sweater the quality was nice the material was not not for me,women's clothing,0

307,"Secret Treasures Women's and Women's Plus Hacci Long Sleeve Top and Joggers, 2-Piece Pajama Set",19.94,4.5,164.0,fantastic comfortable quality pajamas so comfy worth the price holy comfort batman pajama set in camouflage or snakeskin so soft almost a 5 i recommend these pjs soft but clingy pajamas pjs run save your money very nice quality and super soft soft but large nice pjs my picky daughters love them disappointment and will be returned great pjs but get a different one super cute cozy soft and comfortable i want more of them i love this set it s so cute best pjs,these are amazing and even softer than last year s i always size up because i like my pj s to be extra roomy and cozy they are light weight but warm the only con is that on the tops with the wording they put a double layer of this extremely itchy backing on the inside of the shirt behind the words i guess to protect the stitching which is kind of crazy to me since it s just a pajama top lol the first layer just came right off but the second they actually stitched over it so no matter what you do you re left with the itchiest fabric ever right on your chest idk about you but i don t like to wear an undershirt while i m at home but that s literally the only con i ve had these for less than a week and worn them 4 times washed between i promise because they re just so comfy and soft i do think the top is a bit larger and the pants definitely run a full size if not two larger than the size i got 2x and i have some thunder thighs so if i m saying that i m sure someone slimmer can easily size down worth the price of much more expensive pajamas i love the cuffed hems so that the pant legs aren t dragging on the floor medium weight so that you won t feel like you re sleeping in a snowsuit very comfortable generously sized one caveat the fabric snags on raggedy fingernails but there isn t any damage when i free the snag first off these are incredibly soft and comfortable second they are thinner that what i expected however if they were any thicker i think they d be too hot to sleep in underneath my weighted blanket after putting them on i immediately came back to throw another design in my cart they fit roomier than a normal xl and i m completely okay with that i m 5 2 and the length in both legs and arms is perfect please take this into account if you re taller as i m sure they d fall short great pajamas i ordered too big that s ok they will not shrink absolutely so very soft ncan t complain about these pajamas just do not think you need to go up in size so very soft i wear a 2x and bought a 2x in the hearts and loved the set enough to buy the stars they fit perfectly and are very soft the bands on the arms and legs fit loosely and will ride up when you sleep after a few washes the pants do not drag on the floor however and i am a petite 5 ft 3 in overall i love the cuteness and comfort of these i love the comfort of these pj s they are roomy but true to size if you like snug order a size smaller i had a little skin irratation from the tops with stitched in patch phrases on front but the plain ones were fine i bought 5 pair and a secret treasure set last year last year the quality seemed a bit better but still very nice and comfortable love them these pajamas snag very easy when washed and put in the dryer the bottoms come out stuck cling together in the legs they are very soft and comfortably warm the pjs had an odor to them which washed out they must be washed separately from other items because the red ran luckily i washed them by hand when i placed the wet top on a white towel it turned pink the white dryer sheet also turned pink and it ran onto the white lettering the material is made from polyester and recycled polyester it is thin and soft and comfortable i am not sure if they will be too hot to sleep in i have slept on them yet i do not recommend i feel like i wasted my money these pajamas are cute at first glance then it goes south quickly first they are huge second i wore them 1x and the shirt catches onto everything so it snagged and there are 2 hole in a matter of 2 hours of wearing these third the bottom of the pants were pictured to be the kind that are tighter good for me bc in short well they are very stretched out and not very nice looking finally they are very very thin and see through soft as can be i saw these on an influencer s page and she raved about the quality and the softness so i ordered them and i agree 100 buying more for christmas gifts look much more expensive than they actually cost these pj s are so soft they do run 1 size too large i figured since i have to shorten them anyway i will just run a seam up the sides why do they make plus sizes so long just because we are a plus size we aren t 7 feet tall i especially like the pants they are comfortable roomy and don t ride up easily the set will be great for wearing in the fall and spring and maybe warmer winter nights soft bought for my daughter and they love them fit perfect true to size top is a little big great length on sleeves and pants i will buy more they are warm but not heavy weight wash and dry great material is horrible 100 thin and not good at all does not compare with any other pajamas they make definitely a return item for me due to low fabric quality love the pants not so much on the top the writing on the top is so thick and heavy that in a few days it has already pulled the shirt out of balance these run true to size in the pants i think the top is one size smaller bought for my best friend and she loves them super comfortable adorable design and fantastic price these pajamas exceeded my expectations they are super soft after first wash still super soft and comfy i love the pockets in the pants overall i would recommend to a friend and buy some more pairs in the future pants are so comfy i like the top too however the top is itchy inside where the stitching is for the lettering love these pjs so comfy cute flattering and soft i love that these actually cover my ankles i m 5 8,women's clothing,0

this is really warm weather would definitely recommend this dress this is a beautiful dress the color in the pictures aren t true to the dress it s a deep red the fabric is heavy in a good way the seams are well done and sturdy it fits wonderfully it is easy to take care of it has buttons on the sleeves to dress it up a little the neckline is not too low which is nice it made me feel classy in it c wonder dress is short sleeve with a gold button on each sleeve there is also an extra button in a small plastic xiploc bag fit and flare dress size xl color is tango red has a true waist seam with a scoop mevk short sleeve cuff detail the dress has a zipper closure in the back and goes to high hip materials 73 percent polyester 24 percent viscoe 3 percent spandex ponte the color of this dress is beautiful i love the color and this is the positive there are negative comments about this dress it is very heavy for a dress and is very short in length i would not recommend this dress nor would i buy this dress it appears to be of good quality and a durable material it really looks like this dress would fit short or petite ladies this lovely red dress can be great for the office and can have accessories added to it to go out on the town great date dress it has a back zipper but it has enough stretch in the material to just pull over your head great for those of us who live alone has a scoop neck sewn in darts short sleeves nice gold button on each sleeve just a nice added touch love the versatility of this dress and the red color is great well made heavy material should be able to be worn comfortably in cooler weather dress runs large had to return and re order an xs because my usual medium size was way too large i am 5 5 tall 118 lbs with a 28 waist and 33 bust size small is much too large for me see pictures i would guess it is 2 3 sizes too large i was sad it didn t fit because the quality is very good nice thick material you definitely can t see through it you could wear it with only a bra and panties underneath with no problem that s definitely a plus for me to not need so many layers cute modest design dress came down to my knees although with the proper fit it may lay slightly higher than that great dress just buy a smaller size than you traditionally wear this is a beautiful dress in the color of red you can dress it up or dress it down the material is thick and would be great for all year around i put on a pair of leggins with a pair of low cut boot heels the dress is suppose to fir at the waist line and flare out at the bottom i am 5 4 and 105lbs the dress is a tad bit big for me being an extra small there was about 2 inches lose on both sides the dress came right to my knees and the shoulder s fit perfect i plan on having it altered to fit better around my waistline i would order a size smaller than your normal size i was hoping that the xs would fit me the color is a true red i will use this dress for going out and everyday wear it is appropriate for work in the office it has a zipper from the back of your neck to your waistline easy to zip and unzip it has a cute little gold button on both sides of the sleeves this dress is machine washable however i do recommend laying it flat to dry i love the style and the bottom flare out look the neckline is perfect too it isn t to low or feel that it is choking me the only reason i give this beautiful little red dress 4 stars it fits like maybe a medium in an extra small i am right at 25 inches in the waist other than that it is a perfect dress that don t look cheap ad the quality is made with love i have attached two photos of me wearing the dress and how lose it is around my waistline if you normally wear a medium go with a size small please see photos the dress is beautiful it s classy looking heavier fabric than i expected this is a good thing as it s very well made it will keep me warm in cold weather it is very well crafted seams are sturdy the color is bright brighter than the pics show it s a true red it made me think power it has little buttons on the sleeve to dress it up so it doesn t look severe it s the kind of dress that you can dress up and be flashy or leave it simple and elegant it s easy to take care of simple enough for church dressy enough for the office the color red is very pretty but the fabric is too thick the dress is too boxy and it is not a good dress this is got to be one of the squarest and ugliest dresses i ve ever seen it does absolutely nothing to flatter your shape i wear an xlarge but this dress is way over sized for an xlarge it is very plain and outdated if the color of it was black it would look like something somebody would wear when they are in mourning although the fabric is nice and seems to be of good qualify it will still be a dress that i will not wear since it is too big and too dated for my age range so unless you have a funeral to go to i suggest looking for a different dress i am normally size l but these fit like xl will give it away as i don t want to deal with returning i am normally size l but these fit like xl will give it away as i don t want to deal with returning i am normally size l but these fit like xl will give it away as i don t want to deal with returning dress fits perfectly knee length soft comfortable fabric i love it beautiful red color sleeve length is just right quality made will last for years a it is a really nice dress made form good material better then i expected material is too thin k dress is too boxy all around a disappointment very comfy dress love the material size runs bigger overall great dress no style flat it is thick but not warm enough for winter but too hot for summer great quality great price fits true to size you can dress it up or down it can be worn at least three seasons i love my new red dress i looks and feels amazing on the material breathes easy and falls in all the right places it make a casual day at the office look nice with the right accessories i got al ot of complements on it while wearing it,women's clothing,0

311,No Boundaries Juniors' Mom Jeans,13.98,4.4,133.0,3 seasons i have the black and the light wash buy i loved them i own all of them excellent value love these perfect jeans super cute run small and no stretch not too well for me very tight tall girls great jeans for sweater and bootie weather thick fabric great best mom jean do not think about it 10 10 sizing off,i love these jeans i think i bought them in 3 colors and ended up keeping 2 i love the slouchy artist type fit i think they look good with a tucked shirt like an old nirvana tee or a baggy button down tucked in i love how they look with mules or birks i d say they re 3 season appropriate excepting winter i probably will try to style them with a sweater and boots and see how it goes maybe with long johns underneath they were recommended from an ig influencer but i don t remember who now i follow mainly midsize women they look great on me almost 40 years old and a size 14ish depending on the brand and the fit i know i kept the light wash and i think i kept the black i honestly feel like these look higher quality than walmart i just couldn t justify 3 pairs of the exact same jeans i usually hate wearing jeans but i dont want to take these off they are comfortable cute and perfect height on the waist i love them bought medium wash and dark wash sized down to a 9 and i m glad i did if you want them to be baggier go up a size but i liked them better not as baggy chart says i wouldve been more of an 11 also i m 5 10 most of my height is in my legs and they are perfect length such good jeans they are way better than american eagle jeans and cheap the only thing is that they run small so i would size up had to get 2 sizes bigger than my normal size also the rips on the jeans are big but i like that just wanted ti point that out i have these in every color the black ones run a tad smaller so i ended up buying 2 sizes but im keeping them both my very favorite jeans i own there is zero stretch to these and they are juniors so if you are a woman id size 1 to 2 sizes up from your normal size these jeans are gorgeous excellent quality and an amazing price i am short 5 0 so unfortunately for me they were a no go too long even cuffed up the holes waist just didn t hit the right spots for me worth giving these a try if looking for some trendy jeans i like how thick the jean material is the quality seems on par with jeans from old navy or target i got medium wash in size 1 i wanted a size 3 or 5 so they would fit as desired slightly loose but they were sold out at my store in those sizes so i got 1 because i would rather have than not have i like them a lot i would love to see how they look in size 3 on me but ill have to search walmarts in my area seriously these are my favorite jeans finally mom jeans that are comfortable and you can sit and breath in lol i bought 2 pairs i am 110lbs and ordered a size 5 they fit exactly how i want them too not skin tight but flattering and can wear a belt i suggest sizing up one since it is junior sizing i am giving these jeans 4 stars only because they run a small and have no stretch i am 5 2 and 145 lbs i normally wear a 6 8 in women s jeans and can wear 7 9 in juniors i had to size up to 11 in these jeans i think i could have gotten away with a 9 if there was any stretch at all they are super cute i bought the black im 4 11 140lbs and they were a bit tight definitely didnt fit my body they felt stiff which even if were to wash i feel like they wouldn t break them in well i returned them i wanted to like them because so many bloggers raved about them unfortunately for me they didnt work or flatter my figure what so ever im 4 11 140lbs and they were even tighter than the blue ones i received just like everyone said they would be didnt fit my body they felt stiff which even if were to wash i feel like they wouldn t break them in well i returned them i wanted to like them because so many bloggers raved about them unfortunately for me they didnt work or flatter my figure what so ever im 6 foot and usually a size 6 at ae and i know walmart tends to run small so i ordered up to a 9 these were still very tight no stretch at all but could button they were a good 4 inches too short i could have easily ordered up to an 11 theyre really cute but just too short its like sisterhood of the traveling pants these jeans seem to fit a lot of body types they are great im a 2 4 in womens after reading the reviews i went with a 3 for a little tighter fit they are perfect if i would have sized up they would have been too baggie its really how you want them to fit if you want them loose i would size up these are amazing you definitely need to size up i m normally a size 6 or 8 i went with a size 9 but they ripped from being tight so i m repurchasing a size 11 they do stretch out however after wearing for a few hours but once you wash them they re nice this look really nice fit well and are affordable the only reason i docked them a star is because they are really thick not sure if all the colors are but they are going to need a few washes and lots of fabric softener i have other jeans from no boundaries and these are not my favorite because of the fabric i do still wear my normal nb size love the fit of these jeans i went up one size from my normal and they are still pretty tight on the waist and thighs i would have gone up two sizes for a true mom jean style decent length i m 5 7 they hit right above my ankle and the knee holes hit at the right spot can t beat the price i m 5 8 and 150 lbs i got a size 9 and they fit perfectly do not have much stretch but feel like worn jeans best pair of mom jeans i have found for my body normally mom jeans are so big around my waist but these actually fit nicely don t let the stock photo fool you i have been wanting a pair of jeans like this forever and these are perfect i have a similar pair from hollister and you can t tell the difference i order a size 3 and a 5 i am 5 3 and weight 120 they both fit but the 5 fits a little loser on the leg i kept both because they give a different look depending on whether you want them tighter or loser i would not size up also i ordered the medium and dark washes i think the dark one has less stretch than the medium one get this i am so impressed with these jeans and will be purchasing in every color they are so comfortable with the perfect amount of stretch i m 5 2 120 lbs size 26 waist i ordered a size 7 in the medium wash and they are veryy roomy in the waist could have sized down to a 5 and still had that looser mom jean look super cute jeans my only problem was sizing i weigh 108 and am 5 1 and i got a size 5 it was one size too big i ordered a 3 not horribly but loose also the size chart said to get a 7 or 9 because i have a 27 inch waist so glad i didn t i buy size 5 or 27 in jeans at least thats what i buy from abercrombie i bought a size bigger than what im usually am and they fitted small still on me and the bottom knee down its really baggy,women's clothing,0

314,"Just My Size Women's Plus Size Pull on Stretch Woven Pants, Also in Petite",15.55,4.5,4770.0,best plus size jeans ever a perfect fit true petite length love them very soft great fitting jeans love them great jeans changing manufacturers is not always a good thing needed all elastic waistband fantastic love them great fitting jeans great comforting jeans inexpensive and fits well would buy again great buy great fit quality and style stellar price perfect for my purpose fantastic good generic pull on pant,walmart should have kept these available in the store this brand is high quality they fit wonderfully and the pricing is reasonable wish walmart would go back to the brands they had before the monopoly brand that are now in womens is awful bring back just my size george and white stag i absolutely love these pants they are so comfortable plus i like the stretch material and the fact they fit perfectly true to size i also like it that it comes in petite for short people like myself i would recommend these pants especially if you are looking for reasonably priced ones too i am very pleased with these pants for the 1st time in years and years i didn t have to hem them other petites have always needed hemming i am 5 1 having deep front pockets is another major plus offering them in a slightly lighter wt fabric for summer would be nice love these pants they are perfect for me for work very comfortable only problem they are too big i always buy a size up in case they run small and would love to buy the next size down a couple pairs actually but never seem to be back in stock hope they come back soon if they had belt hoops i could just wear a belt not complaining just hoping they come back with my size i m stuck with just the navy because that s what we have to wear at work these great fitting jeans 2x petite i am short and heavy and these jeans fit just great they have spandex in them so they are very comfortable love them have 5 pairs of them i have worn them for the past 2 years walmart quite caring them in the store and i found them again in walmart on line i was so happy love them very comfortable i recommend washing them in cold water alone before putting them in with other clothes the denim dye bleeds in the water i normally don t wash separately but i was sweating a lot and the top of my foot turned blue from the dye i ordered online 3 pairs for my 79 year old mom who fits a petite size she received two of the pants the next business day and the 3rd one the following two days she loves them all her feedback to me was that they are very confortable and fit perfectly she just needed to do a very slight hem less than an inch my mom usually has a difficult time finding pants that fit her well because of her height and weight but these pants overall fit her perfectly we definitely would purchase again in the future thanks walmart the only reason i am giving these a 3 is because both pair on the left pocket have little nubs of material like when something is old and gets washed too much i love these jeans they fit perfect the only jeans i wear so i kept them i did send an email to customer service to try and get some compensation i have been purchasing these pants for work for many years i am very much aware if the differences since you have a new manufacturer quality is no longer there loose stitching in the crotch and belly areas i wear petite and these are longer than the former item many changes i will need to look elsewhere to find a better purchase the pants are comfortable but there is no elastic in the front waist band and it keeps falling down i had to add elastic to it then they fit just right pockets are rather shallow sure would be nice to have a little deeper pockets and elastic in waistband comfortable and soft these pant are great for casual and work wear take straight out of the dryer and no ironing needed please continue making this item with the option of petite perhaps even more colors love them very comfortable i recommend washing them in cold water alone before putting them in with other clothes the denim dye bleeds in the water i normally don t wash separately but i was sweating a lot and the top of my foot turned blue from the dye i love these jeans i am heavy and with the spandex in them i can move around with ease they fit great also i am only 4 11 and these jeans fit me to a t i used to buy them in wal mart store but they do not carry them their any more so i find these in the mail order at walmart and bought one pair and will buy more when possible i 5 pairs now and hope they do not stop making these size 2x petit these are lightweight stretchy jean fabric which is perfect for me as i am cleaning houses all week and these do not limit my movements by being too tight or too heavy when working in hot weather or in a hot house i dont care about the style or how they look as a fashion statement but for my personal opinion they work perfect for me they also have pockets so i can slip my phone and keys in and not forget to grab when i leave my workplace the elastic is not real tight elastic so will probably not last as long as better quality more expensive jeans but i am using bleach products all week so that will ruin them before the elastic stretches out i give 5 stars for these reasons great pants inseam is perfect waist sits where is it supposed to they stay up so the crotch isn t at my knee the fabric is substantial and the stretch holds up for frequent laundering i only wish they made smaller sizes i need a smaller size after weight loss this summer but i find i m in the size range where i will have to shop another brand i would also like to see more colors in this style these are perfect for the office or running around they are a sturdy weight dressier looking than the denim choices and wash well going by the size guide i ordered the 3x the waist is just a bit larger than i need but not so large that it s obvious under my shirts hopefully they ll shrink a little i got the dark brown and the park ranger color sorry i can t remember what it s really called and really like them both wish they had an olive green color too can t beat this price either how do they do it it s like they re tailored 3x petite hem sizing they re perfect the dark wash is ideal for styling and hiding imperfections the fabric is thick enough for me some said the quality of density has declined but they re pull on jeans so it s what i expected but they feel like typical stretch denim so i love that there s room where it s needed the front and rear and the thighs but it s slight so they don t look messy just appropriate thanks jms and walmart helps to know when i need close at whatever size there s still somewhere fair to turn just because one is big temporarily or not doesn t mean we don t need stylish on trend clean neat options enough with the crazy prints and square cuts like we don t have dimensions thanks again these are my absolute first choice for wearing around the house especially for cleaning or yard work because they are very comfortable and not tight they are also very durable since the waistband is elastic it doesn t bind when i bend over however the fabric is not stretchy at all so these are not my first choice for wearing when i want to look good for that i buy super stretchy skinny jeans excellent jeans for those of us who don t want jeggings or other similar products they are just right they are true to size are nice material have pockets and a comfortable waist band the legs are not too wide or too clingy pockets too perfect for me please don t ever discontinue these i highly recommend them this is my third pair jms take note there are more women out here than you think who dont want to wear clothes made for 20 year olds but want attractive not stodgy well fitting clothes at an affordable price you can make a fortune wash before wearing states label do this first or risk having dye on skin and undies lightweight fabric easy pull on with 2 front pockets sized true no need to order up or down comfortable light stretch nice length not too short i am 5 ft 7in resemble denim but feel more like cotton tablecloth weight,women's clothing,0
315,Hanes Women's Long-Sleeve Crewneck Tee,7.0,4.0,1373.0,excellent buy a size up runs small i bought one in every color came back for more runs small order up at least 1 size too short run very small stains very good my order the perfect long sleeve tee shirt not true to fight great buy honest small runs big but worth it great for keeping you warm or in a c or in winter,i buy these for my mom beautiful colors i bought three wish there were more colors available i love the fit and they are very comfortable since ninety percent of my clothing over the past fifteen years has come from walmart i can honestly say that this is another walmart purchase that hasn t let me down i think anyone would be pleased with these and you can t go wrong with either the quality or the price i ordered a large as other review stated this shirt runs small after one washing and hanging to dry it fits just fine however i usual wear a medium it is a nice shirt however they run small i wear a medium to a large depending on the cut i ordered a large as i wanted it to be loose it was tight on me i will exchange it for a xl these were so inexpensive i bought them in every color good for everyday knocking around the house right now i have one on they run a tad bit big thats my opinion i bought large because they were inexpensive i was afraid they would be small not so probably fair to say runs true to size i am a med took a large its a bit long better big then small can t beat the price nice material and color workmanship seems good but sizing is small i would normally order an xl but because i wanted this as a larger around the house or sleep shirt i ordered a xxl lucky i did because it s just going to fit hoping it won t shrink but the xxl is more like a large length is nice though as far as it ll cover the hips and i m 5 2 this top ran a lot smaller so barbie where these tops run small and they do shrink i did not keep it i ended up giving it away and that person told me it was tight on them and they are smaller then i am i ordered these shirts a size larger so it would be a little longer in front but it didn t help it was wide enough but still short so it doesn t cover all of my abdomen for wearing under my scrubs a big bummer especially for making an online order i bought these shirts for an organization and took them to the screen printers still in the package i wear hanes a lot and have never had an issue when i picked up the shirts and tried mine on it was way too tight everyone had the same problem i ordered short sleeve shirts at the same time and they are great included in the pictures is a short sleeve green shirt and a long sleeve black shirt both size xl we lined up the collars and you can see the difference at the shoulders that difference is on both sides i am so disappointed now i have to order new shirts and pay for the screen printing again had a few very large off white stains that didnt wash out thank god i only bought this thing to be an undershirt so no one will see them overall very good must buy a size larger due to shrinkage even in cold water quite comfortable wish it were slightly thicker cotton as in days past well constructed shirt but runs much smaller than size especially in the sleeves its a nice shirt but need to buy it in a at least one size larger than you think you will need it s pretty and soft but i had to reorder for a larger size it was a gift for mother s day and i m still waiting for it to even process haven t even received an email it has shipped never had this problem before and i ve ordered since this virus that s the reason i keep getting when i call three comments that may be helpful to others are 1 the quality of the cotton is top notch the white is 100 top spun cotton which is very soft caution sometimes different colors have different fabric content 2 for my size a 34b with long skinny arms and broad shoulders the medium size after some shrinking was perfect and 3 the style is on the style of a tee shirt which comes out of the dryer somewhat wrinkled this is satisfactory for me as my intent is to use it as a nice lightweight undershirt i ordered a white too small i wear an extra large and it s too tight i ll keep it shorten the arms and give it to my neighbors daughter for a night shirt always a good buy i like for layering and sleeping can t beat the price sometimes hanes can take a few days extra to arrive don t know why this tee was perfect for the first cold day in colorado nso comfy i slept in it great pj top n n n n n ncolorado even though this shirt says small this is extremely small i ordered xl cause i don t like body hugging clothes i bought 2 crew neck and 2 v neck tops the shirts run big but i m hoping with frequent trips to the laundry they ll shrink and fit a bit better still a great purchase these shirts work very well worn alone or under an outer jacket this my second year to order them those from last year are still being worn the work for olds and young women to keep your arms warm,women's clothing,0

317,Dickies Relaxed Fit Cargo Pant,29.99,4.0,459.0,love the fit generous cut dickies work pants quality and sizing great work pants well made comfortable cargo pants very comfortable and functional waistband doesn t hide behind bending over where is the relaxed part wish they were availble in smaller sizes cargo just right add navy blue to get 5 stars love them color comes out afyer just few washes cargo pants my 2nd order love them best cargo pant for work love them great pants horrible fit,i brought the pants for work they are comfortable and i did wash them they did not tear or shrink and i would buy another pair in the future i exchanged for smaller size which is the return credit reorder system straight forward easy i usually wear a 12 i am 5 4 140ish a 10 is plenty big for me the regular is too long by 2 other than sizing being a bit challenging good value these are work pants they wash well and the pockets are the bomb dickies are known for their durability and quality and that is why i purchased these as i wanted a more laid back professional look i was considering purchasing another one in an alternate color but the only thing i dislike about these is the fabric as they appear to attract lint and fade over time it would be nice if these were redesigned with a different fabic that is lint and fade free i love the pants my only complaint is the large gap in the back i had to have an alteration done in the waist love the material and especially the pocket for writing utensils please keep the pocket for pens on the right leg i bought these cargo pants for my job they fit nearly perfect the fabric is light weight i was worried being 100 cotton they would be too heavy and hot similar to uniform pants instead they are quite comfortable the pockets are nicely made bigger pockets would be better i will buy more great buying experience i was amazed especially these days when sizing is all over the place to purchase these pants online and have them fit me perfectly the material is what i hoped for strong enough to use for work or garden but flexible enough to be comfortable pockets are standard not small but not large enough for work tools i would use a tool belt if i needed to carry tools my size was on sale so i got a great deal for the high quality i bought these just for day to day wear because i like the look of cargo pants but now i m thrilled about how useful all those pockets are for phone glasses etc they are also very comfortable i wanted them a bit baggy so i ordered 10 instead of my regular 6 to 8 and that worked well i am 5 8 and they are not super long on me the seam hits about an inch above ground i wear them rolled up so it doesn t bother me size 4 is the smallest offered fits hips ok but get cold air down my behind when i bend down gardening also wear petite and legs are way too long i did like the fabric and all of the pockets disappointed they don t fit so returned them dtc cargo s fit me perfect more sizes i wear a size 10 in all brands of work pants these were ordered in a size 12 because i had never tried dickies workwear so i wanted to order a larger size just to see how the fit was if they were comfortable and not too baggy i would have kept them and ordered more they were so tight in the seat and thighs that to put anything in the pockets of either side would have been nearly impossible the waist was a little snug the rise was way too low and they were extremely long i don t know what the answer was but i m a 32 inseam in these were very long i bought these for my job becasuse ive purchase the original fit cargo pants from your website before this time i couldnt find the same ones so i ordered these and i recieved pants that were male cargo pants and pants that are way to big for me so i dont wear them i wear the first 2 pairs of original fit cargo pants for work i searched many different times but only dickies women s cargo pants are affordable and have pockets i like to take everything to help me while working including the kitchen sink in the words of my momma really love these for work because of the pockets just wish you would add the color navy that s why i only gave 4 stars very comfortable and light weight i m 5 3 and they are very long which is the only downfall as these do not come in a short length other than that they are great quality i bought black i wore them a few times just driving in them afyer only a few washes the color was noticeably lighter at both knees they are comfortable but not worth 30 if dont look decent i bought these for my job that requires a lot of kneeling and bending these pants are great because they have a lot of room for those things the pockets are a good size unlike a lot of women s pants true to size and rugged but not heavy this is my second order for this style of pants i ve had my others for a year now and they are still in great shape although finding the size i need in stock is extremely difficult 6 regular lenght is okay just wish i could get a 6 long because they due tend to shrink a bit in the dryer but by far the best work pants i ve found good quality and just the style i was looking for i wear a 10 or 12 in pants so i bought both to try them the 12 are perfect will be returning 10 i m using these as casual friday pants at the office comfortable and great price too very happy i bought these for work i m a special needs school bus driver i need to neal down for wheelchairs for strapping them in and out things of that nature i have both size 4 and size 6 the 6 are bigger obviously in the waste there s a little more give in the thigh which makes it a little more comfortable for me personally when bending down i wear a belt and i m not worried if i over dry them the 4 fit just right so i m a little more careful drying them so they stay that way i ordered these for work but the fitting was horrible the pants were way to long and the pants legs too wide definitely not for women with curve shape and short legs i also ordered a size bigger then what my usual size and they were still too tight,women's clothing,0
318,C. Wonder Women's Long Sleeve Self Tie Wrap Top,12.99,4.5,11.0,dressy and versatile love it soft stretchy so comfortable c wonder long sleeve self tie wrap top nice dressy blouse two for one really cute blouse for a wrap nice shirt my husband said wow when i put this on not what i had hoped not for me,this wrap top is beautifully made and has a super flattering fit i ordered a large and i m glad i did as there is a little extra room to layer a tank top underneath it s almost necessary to layer a tank underneath due to the plunging neckline of this top the top offers such a good fit the material is stretchy with a little give while not being too form fitting because this top is a classic black and white pattern i believe it will look fabulous in combination with so many outfits you can wear it with red or royal blue capris black slacks or even with a black pencil skirt for a polished outfit dress it up with some statement jewelry pieces and you re good to go it truly is such a versatile piece to have in your wardrobe above all i m truly impressed with the material and the quality of this top i look forward to wearing it for years to come i received the c wonder long sleeve self tie wrap in exchange for this review this blouse is made of an extra soft and stretchy polyester this is not your grandmothers polyester this is a quality fabric i was surprised to find out it s 92 polyester and 8 spandex it is so comfortable yet looks a little dressy it has a three quarter length sleeve it is a v neck wrap blouse and has an inside button to keep it s structure so it lays very nice and stays that way the one i received is a black and white geometric design with a contrasting black trim at the neck and on the tie the v neck is a little deep for me since i m a little more on the petite side so i ll need some type of camisole under it if you re looking for something a bit dressy but extremely comfortable this is the blouse for you it s very versatile you won t regret the purchase the c wonder long sleeve self tie wrap top is a beautiful dressy looking blouse it is black and white in color and has a silky feel to it the blouse has three quarter length sleeves the cross over is secured by a black strip and looks very dressy and elegant this top would look wonderful with a pair of black pants or a silky short skirt i have just received and opened an awesome black and white wrap around tie blouse to do a spark review for walmart i was very pleased as soon as i took it out of the package the material is thick and feels so smooth i was concerned it would be too thin and see through but it is not like that at all the wrap around part has a wide facing liner that is one and a half inches across this facing runs from the bottom edge up to the tie around the neckline and back down to the opposite bottom edge of the blouse this is a nice dress up type of top that can be paired with a skirt or slacks for a dressy look or it can be toned down with a pair of jeans all the fabric seams are surge stitched so there is no chance of frayed edges or raveling this is an indication of just how professionally the top is made it is machine washable in cool water at a gentle setting and can be tumble dried at a low temperature it is a c wonder brand style cws200044 three quarter sleeve wrap blouse i truly like the feel of this 92 polyester 8 spandex material and recommend it this is a very nice shirt i like the design on it has long flowy sleeves the one thing is how it was really cool with her shirt is if you untie it there is a little button that you can completely open it up so you could wear it open with a shirt under it the one thing i didn t really care for was the plunging neckline you would definitely have to wear something under it so your top half does it show or fallout i am a fashionista therefore getting a cute blouse is always a must this blouse is super cute and sooooo comfy even though it is called a wrap blouse it is actually already made like this as a style therefore there is no need to actually wrap it around you just slide on and enjoy this beauty i am not sure what type of material it is made of as i couldn t find any information on any of the labels but it most definitely feels just like polyester and spandex it is super stretchy which makes it really comfortable i love the 3 4 sleeves very cute i have gotten size xl which i normally wear but this blouse feels like it runs a little bit larger than that so i would most definitely suggest getting a size smaller if you are like me and like a more body contoured look the length is absolutely perfect overall i really like this blouse the print is cute too it can be worn on the night out at parties or even at the office love love love i love this tie wrap top it fits perfectly and is very flattering i highly recommend this product fun and comfortable to wear this top was easy to put on and is very lightweight and will be easy to pack when i travel it is wrinkle free too i love it this is a very nice shirt the fabric is soft and it s made well it looks like it will last a long time i washed it and it came out looking brand new my only complaint is it s not true to size i got an extra small and it is a little big on me other than that it s a great shirt just get a size smaller than you normally would super comfortable yet looks nice and dressy very feminine and shows a woman s curves which makes it something you can wear for work a casual event with jeans or dress it up with a skirt and heels i wanted to love this wrap but it looked odd on my body i have a very large chest and it did not cover it the fabric also shows every imperfection in the back so beware if you have any extra fat looked kind of like a maternity top but low cut,women's

loud the design allows for various body shapes to be flattering it s loose but not like boho loose you might size down once it is a generous cut even for plus blouses seems very well made too it s amazing to me what they can do with polyester and it s fashionable very pretty this top is very pretty and seems to be well made it is very sheet so an undergarment or camisole would have to be worn under it my picture on the hanger doesn t do it justice this is a well made lightweight dressy sleeveless shell i ordered an xl this is a generous xl the only problem i have with this item is it is a little lower cut than i like to wear this blouse comes in a lovely dark pink shade the soft flowly material allows for comfort while still being a little on the dressy side this is not a fitted blouse though unlike the other tops i ordered with this it was too large the top itself is beautiful just disappointed it didn t fit why can t we get a generalized sizing for clothing here in the states better yet a required country of origin so we can realize the sizes may be off had a little mix up with the return but walmart corrected it and all is good wish i could have done an exchange but it was no longer available i love this shell the material is nice and soft it has a flow that is real great i will love this shirt in the summer time the short sleeves are nice because you can still wear a bra with it i look forward to wearing this when the weather gets warmer this little shell is a very pretty color it s very lightweight and i would not only wear it as a shirt but also as a shirt underneath another shirt i think it would look good with a sports jacket or even a cardigan i ve had the sleeveless shell for about a week now my granddaughter wore it to a school program and she recieved a few complements on her attire it is something i would recommend to my family and friends i received this as a product for my opinion i think the colors are wonderful i think it s very easy to use and goes with just about everything sizing seems appropriate to fit this c wonder sleeveless shell is beautiful i received it through the spark program the material is soft and silky the cut is great i think anyone would look classy in this shell love this blouse nice and light and easy to care for very cute bright color i wish it was a bit longer nicer than i expected very well made and a nice cut,women's clothing,1

purchase nice soft pjs soft warm great quality wow the tough is amazing,these pajamas are so soft and cozy i bought three pairs in a size 3x after consulting the size chart and measuring my waist my size that fell between the 2x and 3x 2x is my normal size wanting to be comfortable in these and not have them bind around my waist i ordered them in 3x well the 3x is was too big even after washing in hot water and drying at high heat i can still wear them around the house by cinching up the waistband cord i love the feel of the material that i bought two more pairs in the 2x and they fit fine i weigh 205 lbs and stand 5 feet 4 inches tall and the length of the pants are fine in the 2x the sleeves are a little long but can be altered these pajamas are very warm but not too thick and are perfect for working from home they could even be worn out to the store depending on what set you buy that looks more like a jogging suit i am very pleased with these pajamas and the price is right i am so impressed with this set i have bought 5 so far and plan to get more between the beauty comfort warmth and the situation we are in with covid 19 these are the best dressed for in home and even to go to friends store they fit right in love them 5 stars they are great so super soft i can t wait to wear them it hasn t been cold enough yet at our walmart we got in one shipment i saw them loved the design on them the squirrels so cute gone in about a week found them on line thanks love this pj jogging set fabric is so soft and comfortable ngreat for lounging or sleeping walmart made this purchase very easy and quick for me i appreciate the pickup and delivery service very much especially during this time with covid nthank you walmart soft and comfy i got the small and it fits well top is on the baggy side i am 5 feet and 125 lbs good value for the price you can wear it as a track suit around the house or wear the top with jeans it s really comfy and doesn t scream pjs when u see it lol cozy nice material comfy like pjs yet you are dressed enough to go outside even to the store i bought them because i will be in the hospital for a week or so soon and probably in a nursing home for a while after wanted pjs that covered looked nice and gave me the feeling i was dressed and not wearing pjs none thing i would change is the neckline supposed to be crew neck but cut very low too low and a bit too stretchy the pants are soft and comfy i live in southern california and they are enough to keep me warm i do think they run a little big so keep that in mind when ordering so far the only think i don t like is the ankle band they keep riding up i have only wore them a few times so i can t speak on how well they will hold up but so far so good in my book i ordered the heart pants in xl they are perfect for my height 5 4 190 lb pear shaped body so i ordered this 2 piece in leopard print i can t wait to see how the top fits they are soft and roomy enough to lounge or a quick walk or drive to the store walk the dog etc like the design and colors but dislike the elastic ankle cuffs they creep up on my calf and constrict circulation i may cut them off later runs large so i could have possibly taken a size smaller they will do ok for sleeping if i get rid of the ankle elastic i should have listened to myself thinking all the revues that i read said buy one size larger so i did i am a frail petite small as recommended i ordered a size medium and i received a plus 2 piece i just love how it feels but i cant wear them or return them because i took the tags off thats on me i cant afford to buy the set again on me incredibly soft and comfortable the xl fits roomier than normal and i m completely okay with that the length in the arms and legs fits perfect though i m curvy 5 2 so please take that into account now i m just trying to decide on another design to purchase i love secret treasures brand especially since a lot of their things have pockets like this one highly recommend these 2 piece lounge pajama sets are fabulous i purchased 3 and they are incredibly comfortable the fabric is so soft and it s a perfect weight warm but not too hot the colors are beautiful and all of the ones i ordered are true to what is pictured i found they run true to size and if anything are a little roomy which i like they also hold up very well in the wash i would highly recommend them i bought there pjs lounge outfit for both my daughter and i i bought one set and liked them so much i ordered 4 more they are comfy soft and warm if you want winter pjs buy these they are cute to both my daughter and i are curvy and the material is great because it stretches i got a large for both of us the cut is generous the fabric is so soft and not heavy good weight quality and price i purchased two sets in different colors and two additional sets for christmas gifts these pajamas will feel so cozy and warm this winter love these they are perfect for lounging around the house on the weekends they don t look like pajama s although i do sleep in them washed and dried wrinkle and shrink free these pjs are a lightweight velour but warm they are true to size colors are vibrant the arm cuffs could be a little snugger but doable they washed well all in all they are a terrific buy for a two piece pajama set the material is a minky on the thinner side would have given it 5 stars except for the elastic at the ankles why is this added every time you sit down love these i buy these for my 94 year old mom which is in a nursing home she loves the m they are soft and warm the cmas love them as they keep their shape and stretch to easily dress her i cant believe how soft it is and size is correct and the fabric is light a great weight love the fabric colors and washes beautifully the price is very good will purchase the brand again these are so soft and light weight fleece some of the secret treasures i have found to run small however these are true to size and even a bit oversized as a plus size woman i m extremely pleased,women's clothing,1

326,ClimateRight by Cuddl Duds Women's Stretch Fleece High Waisted Long Underwear Thermal Legging,8.96,4.7,105.0,cuddl duds can t beat these in comfort awesome warm love the multi scroll pattern would highly recommend great for layering cuddle duds nice leggings comfy and warm overall love these too big on the top part oversized so warm soft and stretchy climateright by cuddl duds women s and women s plu so soft warm and comfy climateright by cuddle duds women s stretch fleece well worth the purchase super soft i live in these leggings now fuzzy happiness,i ordered to cuddle duds shirts and love them so much that i ordered pants they are so warm and cuddly i love them thank you i don t ever write reviews but i had to with these the quality comfort price fit material is awesome ni wear these under my jeans and also to bed for pjs at night live in n y where it s cold i m winter ni m 5 6 and 95 lbs and got a medium they re a little big in around my waist bc i m so thin but i like them roomy like that no elastic waist like others have stated but they don t fall off me either nlong in leg which is good since i have long legs got 4 colors and like them all haven t washed yet bc i only wore one pair so far but they are warm and thick and soooo comfy you don t even feel them on nyes high waisted but for long john s or pjs who cares roll them down if your shorter waisted ni love these fleece pants not to thick or thin perfect nice and toasty warm thick waistband and it sits up high and wont ride down when you sit they do not work as well under pants as they are not a slippery fabric they have more grab but they are wonderful for lounging and staying comfy at home they work great as leggings under a tunic instead of just tights i love the color its just a pretty shade of blue i wear cuddl duds for running shopping lounging and sleeping i would have liked a small pocket to store my house key while running i bought the multi scroll pattern and it is a nice change from the black leggings i already own a subtle design and color quality fleece that washes great and air drys in a few hours no issues with fit i m 5 10 145 lb and always buy a medium in this brand i love these cuddle duds fleece leggings i found they fit true to size with no need to size up they do fit high on the waist but i don t mind that these leggings are so comfortable and wash nicely the fabric is so soft and just the right thickness cuddle duds are made of warm soft comfy materials for layering under clothes on those cold winter days when you need a little extra for warmth i think they are good quality garments that will last several winters they are good for sleeping in too some people might wear them around the home as lounge wear i wouldn t just because i like looser fitting clothing for that purpose the color is like a heather black and blue the colors i purchased i love them i would recommend these to others i bought the 3x bottoms for reference i wear a 24w plus size in bottoms such as pants sweats shorts skirts yoga pants or leggings i usually go for a 2xl but wanted a more loungy fit instead of a tight fit these do fit snug like thermal under garments i wear 26w on top so i purchased a 4xl in a black top no comment on the fit of the top because i haven t received it yet very comfortable i am not sure why these are classified as underwear leggings i wear mine as regular leggings and they look great the description is misleading very warm and soft i like the pattern and bought the deep red top to go with it once worn the pants stretch out they were a little on the big side so i stuck them in the dryer they did not shrink much in the dryer and i noticed the waist is still a bit stretched out overall the top and pants are very comfortable and warm the only reason this is not a 5 star rating is the waist on these leggings are crazy high and i like high waisted leggings this is too high or perhaps they should make a petitie jeggings for us shorties overall i love them they are so warm and comfy i dont sleep in them however because i get too hot they re perfect for hot cocoa watching a good holiday movie i didnt pay attention to the fact that these are high wasted and boy does that mean high comes right up under my bra and i can see why they say plus sizes i could fit two of me into the size large upper body part of these if you want the regular fit dont buy this one get the normal ones if you re chubby in the belly these will be good i absolutely love these for under my pants they are so comfortable and keep me very warm super soft very warm can be used as under clothes or as pajamas soft and comfy but feels a little tight in the calves i m 5 4 and 113 pounds i don t like anything super tight so i ordered a size medium it has plenty of room in the waist but even though i have thin calves it still feels a bit too tight the length is great though regular pants length not too short like most leggings really happy that this is not the 7 8 pants style that is chopped off above the ankles arrived quickly warm cozy and as advertised washed well have worn as base layer and as a pajama bottom and works equally well either way pleased with purchase extremely comfortable very soft and warm very good quality overall so glad i got them i will live in these all winter also good as long johns and pj bottoms arrived quickly warm cozy and as advertised washed well have worn as base layer and as a pajama bottom and works equally well either way pleased with purchase bought these for a trip to minnesota in my opinion they saved the trip kept me comfortable all day favorite year of these leggings so far they are very soft and have a thicker waist bars than past years quality fleecies these are the softest most comfortable leggings i don t feel like i m suffocating in them could probably have gotten a small instead of medium very warm and fuzzy not to be worn under anything unless you do not mind looking 10 lbs more than you weigh to long i m 5 4 128lbs the material is nice and warm i like the fleece cuddl duds from kohl s they aren t to long,women's clothing,1

330,No Boundaries Juniors' classic skinny jeans,11.88,4.2,1789.0,great price great fit skinny jeans medium blue fit great fantastic jeans perfect fit fits perfect disappointed size matters sizing not enough room in the seat disappointed reorder size up good fit for a very skinny 12 year old great pants not junior cut fit and thinner just what i wanted,i first bought these in white and i wish i would have bought 5 more they are a perfect fit im 52 weigh 135 and i go from a size 9 to 11 so i now have 6 of each color and 6 of each size they wear so good im trying to find the white ones so if anyone knows where to get them let me know you really cantyou really cant go wrong with these jeans theyre perfect received fast delivery they fit really nice after wash should snug up perfect i am reviewing the medium blue not the dark blue nfinally a pair of jeans that fit unlike some previous no boundary junior jeans these actually look good are comfortable and are well made unbelievable for the price too bad these aren t always available ni purchased the size 9 and i am 5 1 and weigh about 117 lb if that helps these inexpensive jeans look wear fit and feel like very expensive jeans they are gorgeous on stretchy and my favorite jeans i have four pairs of them the fit of these are just what i want in a pair of jeans i m 5 4 and 128lbs and bought four pairs of size 9 they re snug but not tight just the way i enjoy my jeans fit post two children love this skinny jeans as the matter of fact own almost almost two in each color the fit is always perfect the fabric is stretchy a little bit they are very comfy and stylish i gave this a 3 star because i purchased the same jeans a year ago they are my absolute favorite when i got the 3 pairs i ordered i found they were shorter and smaller in size then the ones i purchased a year ago the upc numbers were the same i m disappointed this brand is making the size smaller then a year ago i had to order 1 size larger to get what i wanted i ordered a size 15 the paper tag that is attached to the jeans says size 15 but there are two labels sewn in the jeans that says size 13 now i have to go stand in line at the store to exchange them i am beyond frustrated i bought a size 7 in juniors and they are not that they are the size of a girls size 10 at least ridiculous the blue denim jeans are mine a true size 7 pants had a hole in the back fresh out of bag these fit great runs true to size there waist is a bit higher than other low rise which i really like i do not know if buying a size up would help but i have bought these pants for two young ladies now both with normally proportioned bodies and both complained of weird fit in the seat these pants have a shallow seat on a normal person so i would definitely try before buying if you have any posterior curve at all i had ordered a 4 pack special in the spring and black was the most comfortable ones i ordered 3 black pairs for the fall and they aren t even a little bit like the ones i ordered in spring they are shorter the legs are wider the waist is smaller i ordered the same size i previously got and i ve lost about 10 pounds since then there is no reason they should be this much more uncomfortable than the first pair nice comfy stretch jeans i have several of this brand and a couple in this style but this time a 7 didn t fit me but that s what i always get i even looked at all my jeans in this brand before ordering after looking at the chart i got a 7 and a 9 figuring one would fit the 9 were still slightly tighter than the chart stated as well i m going to try an 11 in the next ones and see if that is better so it doesn t look like i ve been painted into the jeans lol im upset that you would discontinue these nobo junior skinny jeans lower medium rise in dark rinse these are by far the best jeans you have ever had i have bought 100 pair in the last 10 years please bring them back the high waist are terrible my 12 year old is very thin with a long torso and legs we have a hard time finding jeans that fit her she said these are very comfortable they are a little short on her but will have to work for this year they come to her ankle very soft and flexible which is nice for pe class since she can t change clothes we ordered the 4 pack wish they had come in many colors i absolutely love these pants they are very comfortable and a great price however the last two time i purchased them online they did not fit for some reason this is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 i will continue to buy them just not online so while the medium blue size 9 jeans fit great these appear to have been made on another person unfortunately the dark blue ones are way too small so be aware that you may be disappointed as well they may be great for a much smaller person they re not for me the reason that i buy juniors size jeans is because i have a short waist and a small butt and thighs i am a woman and not a junior but women s jeans always have extra material in the butt area and a lot more extra material in the outer thighs seam these jeans have both of those things which i hate these should be labeled women s and not juniors also all of the women complaining that you need to size up 1 2 sizes are wrong this is the standard sizing you find at almost any department store in the usa the problem is that some clothing stores put a size 6 on an actual size 10 to compliment but confuse women these jeans are awesome they fit well i did have to return the first pair due to sizes run small and the black jeans had a burnt smell to them nthe second pair fit better and didnt smell,women's clothing,0

335,"George Women’s Maternity Leggings, 2-Pack",15.88,4.2,24.0,best maternity leggings i have come across comfortable opaque and affordable love them amazing quality love these leggings total deal nice for around the house get what you pay for dont understand high review short inseam fantastic leggings comfortable great buy love them see through material run big great value for for standard cotton leggings they re okay,finally a pair of leggings i can wear that don t squeeze my 35 weeks tummy i stopped wearing leggings in the cold ny winter because they were just too tight and uncomfortable i m 5 1 petite now weighing about 135lb for reference i got the size small these leggings are comfy breathable and roomy i am so happy with them these are comparable to my 30 old navy maternity leggings as far as quality goes i bought the black two pack a month ago not expecting them to fit but they are very true to size they re not see through either if you bend over i just ordered 4 more pairs i ll honestly probably wear them after delivery they re just so comfy n n i m a women s size 20 and the xxl fits me with room to spare these maternity leggings are very comfortable very stretching and fit true to size only downside is that they are a little sheer have to wear long t shirts or blouses these are amazing quality they are soft and comfortable i first ordered size small but they felt a little too tight on my calves i reordered in size medium and they are so much more comfortable im 5 1 in height and they fit perfect i weight right now about 119lbs im normally a small and weighed 116 before pregnancy but i would suggest sizing up for more comfort especially if you have a curvy booty and hips the ones from shein are practically see thru these are priced so good i love these leggings i actually bought them at the end of my pregnancy to wear postpartum and i m so glad i did because i ended up needing a csection and these are great to wear over my belly so they don t bother my incision they re perfectly opaque and very comfortable i ve been wearing them nonstop since we came home from the hospital im very pregnant and these have come in handy easy to pull on and not sheer id say they are running a little big probably could have gone a size down these leggings are a little bit baggy around my hips and butt but are fine for lounging around the house or wearing with a long sweater i normally wear a juniors 3 and since juniors maternity clothes don t exist a women s small 4 6 is the best i can do the only thing that would improve this product would be a stretchy spandex tummy panel the panel on these is made out of the same material as the pants and the elastic band digs into the skin above my belly you get what you pay for theyre a decent cheap pair of cotton leggings the waistband is a thin tight band though that i know will drive me nuts once my bump gets even bigger these are see thru when you bend over also the elastic band is under comfortable bc its so bunched and shows thru to the shirts you wear id return but already washed them these are very short the measurements do not show the inseam but says the model is 5 10 she is not i am 5 11 and the leggings barely go past my knees and the top of the belly section has a thick elastic not what i was expecting at all good for 5 5 or less these are great i ordered hoping the quality was good and that they would be see through the quality is good and they are thick to wear they are not see through the colors are nice as well was skeptical because of the price but i absolutely love these will be ordering more went a size up and she loved them fits true to size very comfortable and great price i would say i liked them better than my motherhood leggins love the fit fit like actual leggings not sagging everywhere except my belly and comfy over the bump limed them very much fell in love with them the xl fit like 2x and too lose see through material i ordered the black 2 pack in small i weighed 117 lb pre pregnancy and now i m around 138 lbs in week 30 but still with a small frame i m carrying all in the front and these fit me as i would expect there is a little bagginess in the waist area but most maternity pants bottoms i have seem to be this way to allow expansion as your bump grows n nthe biggest pro for me is the value of these i couldn t find a 2 pack for this price anywhere else most places price one pair at this price and since i m basically living in leggings right now i need multiple pairs the color and opaqueness is about what you would expect from any standard pair of cotton leggings i m satisfied with it n nthe biggest con for me would probably be the bump panel waistband i do prefer the bump panels to be that more spandexy material but again these were such a good price i have a really nice pair of leggings with the panel material i like and they were probably more like 20 25 for one pair the elastic waistband is kind of weird it s thicker and bunchier than most panel waistbands so it s not as comfortable but i have some belly bands i like to wear for the tight support feeling so i wear one of those under this panel and it provides me with the supportive feeling i like and makes the waistband substantially less noticeable and substantially more comfortable n noverall don t expect a super high quality pair of leggings when you order these they re only like 7 50 each go into the purchase expecting a very standard pair of cotton leggings and you will be satisfied if you want a really nice pair and are okay with spending more go for it if you want a few more bump friendly bottoms to wear without having to spend a ton on clothes you ll only wear in certain phases of your life like me these are a perfect option for you i d rather wear sweatpants lol but they re good for if i want to look nice nthe band on the belly is a little uncomfortable but not awful would be better if it was a wide smooth band but it s narrow and sort of bunched up the material is nice they are kinda see through if you bend over really far but c mon you re pregnant how much and how far are you really going to be bending over,women's clothing,0

340,Free Assembly Women's Original 90's Straight Leg Jeans,27.0,3.5,13.0,jeans amazing thick quality i am in love no elastic jeans here very short finally real denim jeans but they are to short madewell quailty runs very small add 4 5 inches to the inseam and try again way too small,great jeans feel and look good on i would recommend you go up a size thoroughly impressed with these i usually spend 80 130 on jeans from madewell or everlane unfortunately i ve gained the covid 19 and don t fit into most of my jeans i didn t want to spend a lot of money on new pairs since i plan to lose the extra weight i decided to get these to hold me over i expected thin and stretchy cheap jeans that s not what i got oh no these are super thick with minima stretch in a good way like a true vintage jean n nthe jeans are pretty snug around the waist and tummy if between sizes size up the cut has a high waist which i find super flattering they re form fitted along the hips and then loosen up along the knees and calves i agree with the other reviewer who said that these are short i m 5 5 and these look cropped but i love the length for booties and loafers n nall in all these have the quality and design of a much more expensive pair of jeans i am recommending these to all my girlfriends and will buy another pair super impressed with the brand best jeans ever super 90s when jeans were heavy and hugged all your curves and sucked you in very few sizes in stores please keep them stocked these are old fashion jeans with a speck of elastic in them which was exactly what i wanted they dont move or flex so if you want spandex and these are not for you the sizing was accurate i actually liked these jeans however at a modest 5 foot 6 they were about 2 3 inches too short if you are shorter like ankle jeans or a cropped look then go ahead and buy them they are almost passable if you wear shoes that come up high on your foot like something that laces up to your ankle or a boot however you cannot wear these with a shoe that comes low on your foot such as flats or loafers because it will look like high waters on anyone who is taller than about 5 foot 4 nthe jeans are a nice wash they come up to the natural waist i found the fit to be tight but also loose i wasnt sure if a size up or down wouldve helped im 128lbs i ordered a size 26 but it wasnt as tight in the waist and butt as i expected although at the same time i found that the zipper was very weak to be tasked with holding you into stiff denim jeans the zipper slid down twice when i was trying it on which would be very embarrassing in public perhaps the quality is not very robust and strong however its possible that the jeans just needed to be broken in i would have definitely kept them but i cant overlook the short leg length will be returning really nice denim but runs very small i was so excited finally 100 cotton jeans they are actually denim jeans love that fact they seem to run small but then again they are denim not stretchy jeans likely true to measurement sizing they do run very short they are high waters im only five six they are to short to wear unless i cuff the bottom and wear them mid calf i checked they don t seem to be offered in long sizing super cute and defiantly feel like expensive jeans i always wear the same size in jeans 27 or 6 these jeans are super tight and i had to suck in to get them zipped so very trendy seems like high quality think madewell but runs small i think i will have to order a size up maybe even two sizes up i was interested in ordering a pair up to the point i realized the only inseam option is 28 5 which frankly on your 5 10 model looks ridiculous who in their right mind wants to walk around wearing what appears to be jeans that end 4 inches short of the ankle bone and it s not just the straight leg version it s every cut and style of these jeans they aren t made for women of average height they re apparently made for women cheated out of leg length these jeans run about two sizes smaller than what was ordered runs small other than that great pair of jeans fabric material very good 90 s jeans i don t remember wearing high water jeans in the 90s these are crop pants not jeans need to let us know does it stretch and is it 100 cotton what is the length,women's clothing,0

348,Nlife Women Long Sleeve Lace Up V Neck Top,23.99,4.2,277.0,comfortable and size was accurate cute great staple to any closet soft and comfy really cute top very pretty sad pleased disappointed do not recommend horrible quality don t bother purchasing this item picture is deceiving blouse is ugly long but one in every color overpriced,very cute shirt i am 5 4 about 115 lbs and ordered my normal size of medium it fit me nice and is long enough to wear with leggings which was a plus but it also looks great with jeans the sleeves were not to short and came just a tad below my wrist it s very comfy and the v neck is not to low washed in cold water dryed on the lowest setting and it came out like new good fit absolutely a great piece i wear a 2xl and it fit correctly the cut is flattering for all sizes and the quality is great soft but not hot fabric and i love the lace up in the front this piece does not need an undershirt love it in the pink i really like this top its soft comfortable and true to size it is kind of see through though so i will be wearing a cami underneath it overall i would buy this top again awesome shirt it fits true to size so simple but yet elegant it is very soft and comfortable material it washes well and is high quality i m very happy with my purchase great shirt unfortunately it runs ver small i had ordered two of them cant wear them so im donating very sad that they claim to be 2pplus when they are no more than extra large ni would recommend it to anyone who is extra large otherwise no beware of sizing just as pictured on model very soft material but it does run large i will buy another in a different color and size down also nlife shirts are returnable at walmart store the top is very long on the model and since i m only 5 4 1 2 tall one would think it would be long on me it isn t doesn t look good with leggings so will wear with jeans it s just an ok top the sizing is a joke i typically wear a large and ordered over sized 2x to allow for sizing running small shrinking in laundering etc it looked more like a medium at best and was tight it may work great for people that have a really small figure but i didn t find it worth the time and money to order returned it horrible worst thing i have ever ordered and vendor refuses to give credit they want to make a deal with you for selling crappy merchandise do not order i ordered this shirt 2 sizes bigger than i normally wear and it barely fits love the purple color the lace up front is nice but the lace is a shoe string very thin material and no information regarding what type of material sizes run very small returned to walmart and because item was shipped by third party vendor i have to wait 6 8 weeks for my card to be credited picture is deceiving the blouse looks to be warm but i would have never ordered this blouse if i knew what it actually looks like the neckline is ugly and doesn t look like the picture i will wear it as a p j top but not in public i like this shirt because its simple but cute the material is close to a sweater material so its thicker than i imagined so im not sure it will be great for a hot summer day it is somewhat see through so a cami will need to be worn under it overall great value for the price fits tts this would be better for summertime because of its lightweightness very lovely color and design nnice long length and sleeves the shoe lace looking tie is not as bad as people say the shirt is not true to size it s as if i ordered a size up but it s comfortable and isn t transparent i feel like the short sleeve version of this top fits a bit better true to size i take the string out makes a beautiful v neck line this was cute but ended up returning due to the strings being so long and very low cute otherwise the material and color was very nice i haven t worn yet but am excited to i love the look of the top the feel of the material makes me want to snuggle in the material is very thin it runs a little long so don t order a larger size than you wear i would not have paid 17 95 for it if i knew how flimsy it is i like it but wouldn t pay more than 10 for it,women's clothing,0

350,Time and Tru Women's V-Neck Sweater,13.0,4.4,41.0,beautiful but mind your sizing fantastic non suffocating no itch comfy sweater looks and feels expensive must have for fall where is it orange and blue get this runs large order a size down loose fitting looks like window blinds on fabric not flattering nope wash it on delicate and hang dry feels nice looks awful feels expensive incredibly soft fabulous great pullover,oh boy this sweater is really beautiful it is constructed well and the material is extremely soft however i guess i missed something in the description it is huge i don t mean oversized i mean three if me could climb in i know it s an oversized leggings sweater but this was too much for me in terms of fit it has a raglan shoulder and the sleeves are slim the v neck is pretty much perfect especially if you want to layer but the body is ginormous i am a solid l in all things time and tru my fav brand and i m returning these in l for a small so it will fit more like a loose ish normal style sweater too pretty not to try again order your regular size only if you want it super big wonderful sweater loved it so much i bought several in all colors very comfortable not hot at all thin with stretch i am a size 16 18 with tata s and a stomach and i got the xxl so if it shrank it would be ok highly recommend washing in cold water and laying flat to dry great run around sweater but need more color choices size suggestion go up in size should you want oversized i m in love with this sweater it looks and feels so expensive and fits just perfectly it is so soft i have it in red and the color is true to how you see it online i am 5 foot 3 and about 125 pounds i have the small and it is perfect with jeans or leggings super soft and snuggly comfortable and roomy without being overbearing mid weight and easily dressed up or down very flattering if you have a belly at all and looks way more expensive than it was my only gripe where is one in blue how can you not have it in blue or orange for fall make more colors please this is such a cute sweater not see through light fabric and flattering fit almost a tunic length and of course the price thinking of purchasing more colors i am a size 12 and bought a large but it is still really baggy on me it definitely runs large i love the color and style though especially the collar so i m going to exchange for a medium and hopefully it fits better my sweater is a nice bright red and the knit is fair noting the other reviews i ordered a medium even though i usually wear a large i wish that i had purchased a small instead because the fit would probably have been better the width of the sweater is very wide and most noticeable in the back notice how it hangs on the model who is wearing a size small wonderful fabric feel great cut overall on sweater shape v neck neckline is modest and elegant both the color selection of delicate ivory is not at all nice looking as it appears online the delicate ivory color is a low quality looking yellow ivory so indeed not a lovely soft ivory the delicate ivory color is electronically adjusted online to appear as nice ivory also this is a detail which is equally unappealing the fabric has slats that make it look like window blinds the slat design is highly prominent on fabric design and downgrades appeal of sweater this shirt feels soft and the length is nice however this shirt is extremely unflattering i m honestly not sure what body shape this would look good on obviously different body types look good in different shapes this shirt flairs out and gives an exaggerated middle making anyone s stomach and waist look larger than it is not a flattering look i bought this sweater today in red and wine today size small the colors are gorgeous the fabric is soft and lightweight but the fit is so unflattering on me i m 5 8 tall 140 pounds hourglass shape with somewhat broad shoulders and long arms torso disappointing because the colors and fabric are fabulous it s truly hit or miss on clothes i ll be glad when we will be allowed to try clothes on in the stores i read all the other reviews first and was thrilled wore it the next day after getting it then i washed it it shrank it was a 2x not anymore i want to cry this is so buttery soft i m in between a medium and large and i needed the medium so size down if you are in between sizes love this sweater got it in 2 colors this sweater was hideous waaaayyyy oversized like by 2 or more sizes the arms are tight fitting but the body fits like a balloon very wide at the hips which is very unflattering the material is soft and cozy but its oh so ugly omg i saw this sweater on instagram and did not think i would love it as much as i do it is rayon and feels great and looks great ijust ordered t in black too bought this in red gorgeous color returned it as it looked odd on me would probably look great on a different body type it seems to be a little on the big size so you may need a smaller size than normal i love mine great shirt for the price size up for the perfect leggings sweater better than expected soft patterned true to size quality purchase i m ordering it in a second color a easy pullover top to wear with leggings and jeans lightweight and comfortable love the color and softness of sweater but need a smaller size,women's clothing,0

358,Secret Treasures Women's and Women's Plus Traditional Front Zip Robe,9.99,4.8,161.0,one of my favorite robes ever very luxurious feel great find for the money very happy with purchase definitely will buy again great choice right price get one of these robes right now you will thank y my favorite robe soft bathrobe a lot to like with this robe great price and product lovely very bright red and comfortable warm and cozy without being heavy comfy great robe great grandma so soft very positive beautiful and well made,love love this robe it is inexpensive and the quality and comfort are the best i ordered a large and i wear a 14 it is roomy and the zippered front is great for getting in and out of it i use cold water to wash it and low heat to dry i want it to last and i highly recommend it as it is a bargain this is so soft it absolutely reminds me of baby items luxurious soft feel i think this will be a very nice gift for a young teen nice color choices the pink is a mauve i m glad i found it at such a good price i almost wish i had bought another for myself purchased this robe for the upcoming chilly mornings in photo showed a below the knee length this robe fits me to my ankles and i am 5 foot 3 i ordered one size larger than i usually wear and i have ample room material is a brocade and it looks and feels great on the price was just right too got this in purple and on sale wasn t sure what to expect and because of the reviews gave it a chance not disappointed well made and the color exactly as shown soft comfortable well made and washes well some complained of the extra fabric around the zipper not a big deal at all and does not get in the way of the zipper i have been looking for this type of robe for awhile just enough to keep out the chill without getting hot i am 5 4 and it comes to about 2 from my ankles so will be shorter on a taller person just don t understand how i missed this in past searches arrived in a timely manner packaged well pleasantly pleased beautiful bright red soft other reviews did not specify if this was a zipper type that you had to step in to it is not it does unzip all the way down others did mention the inside seam along the zipper not being tacked down seems to be the norm for this brand easy fix nothing a needle and thread can t take care of or even some hem and iron adhesive tape i have last years robes same brand that i also stitched closed this brand washes and wears very well this will be a nice addition to my other robes on sale and the price was just right very soft and comfortable i like it that it completely unzips all the way nice pockets i ordered the red robe really liked it so i ordered the light blue one but it is actually a light lavender and i also ordered the pink robe buts its actually a mauve im thinking about getting the navy blue and the slate gray i live in pajamas seldom get dressed so these are perfect for me this winter i ordered this brand last year and really liked them so much i bought 3 then coral purple and light gray and the rollback price cant be beat its a steal i am currently on my 2nd robe i love it so much that i bought them as christmas gifts for my family this year these are more like a house coat or cover for a night gown or pjs not a shower robe the velvet plush will only get stiff and cold and feel super gross if used as a towel or shower robe great for lounging on the couch cuddling with animals and housework i usually wear mine every day in the evenings after work and wash about 1 every week or sometimes 2 weeks great quality this could easily be a 50 robe like what you would find at bb i love them i have 10 every year i buy 2 or 3 more the material is great they have nice big plus sizes to make it loose and comfy and a zipper i even wear in summer with a c i love them so much sizing is generous i could have easily ordered a size down color true super soft inside and out the length was a little longer than expected what i don t like the inside part of the zipper wish it was sewed down so it didn t get in the way of the actual zipper otherwise i like it and would recommend but i would also mention the negative about the zipper i like this robe i dislike this robe the fabric is soft and warm the zipper operates smoothly pretty design on the fabric well constructed the size runs big but hard to be sure because the robe is completely shapeless it is like wearing a rectangular piece of fabric i think i will taper it in at the waist with the old sewing machine or perhaps add some darts for a bit of shape wish it was full length i am 5 5 and it is well above my ankles overall i like it enough to buy 2 of them red and purple both are vivid colors which i love also a great price here other than being short and shapeless i love it i love this robe not to hot or to long just right for chilly nights of fall into winter the price cannot be beat and i ordered my older sister one she loves hers will buy another one soon very satisfied liked this from last year and wanted another one so soft and lovely that i couldnt choose between two colors then i decided to purchase two the colors rose and dark purple i just love them one of the most comfortable and soft robes i ve ever owned love the zippered front i do wash it in cold water on gentle and also low dryer heat i bought the medium because if want have it on hand if i lose weight it is snug for my size 14 i love this robe it s warm and cozy without being heavy the fabric has a self embossed pattern sizing is true sleeves can be cuffed tor adjustable length the secret treasures label always indicates quality at a reasonable price for me comfortable and very warm fits great and so soft most times i reach for it instead of a blanket and have even fell asleep in it because it s so soft and warm absolutely in love with this robe wish they had in black i this robe purchased 2 of them very soft beautiful design i am 5 3 and this comes down to nmy ankles which is fine with me the price is ncertainly right vey happy with my purchase love the price these robes are warm very roomy and long liked them so much had to get every color unfortunately the black was sold out in my size will check back again very satisfied i received both of my robes today and they were so soft and comfortable i was going to purchase more today for christmas gifts

362,"Hanes Men's and Big Men's Tagless Short Sleeve Tee, Up To Size 6XL",6.0,4.3,1698.0,true to size nice when you can t find this shirt in your size tagless or not spots on one shirt dont buy cheap shirts not new warning not cotton chemically dyed rags not good what happened to haynes shirts awful clothing purchase all cotton comfortable great for maternity an order i received poor fit of my regular size good but great little basic cotton t shirt thick cotton t shirts,these are nice nice and roomy i got the men s shirts sleep in them it s big on me i wear a 3x in womens but i got them bigger then i should have but they wash and dry up really nice i wear f y i with my pm bottoms probably out two people in the shirt but i like all the extra room i have ms and sometimes it hurts for me to wear clothes that s one reason why i get them so big 5 stars for color 1 star for fit i needed this exact color of shirt to go with my favorite pants i bought 8 maroon shirts everywhere online hoping for a match but this hanes was the only correct color however hanes didn t have it in women s or in smaller men s sizes lucky me i can sew so i bought the remaining xxxxlg men s size and easily cut out a perfect shirt for myself great match what do you think yes i m old 76 girls in my generation all knew how to sew the fatigue green color is really nice love the color it also feels a bit different than the other colors i would say maybe stiffer able to hold shape more almost feeling thicker it also runs a tiny bit smaller than the blue and black shirts i ve purchased the description says tagless but there are tags on these shirts i bought a lot of 6 x shirts bc they are hard to find i put the orange one on saturday first time my the middle of the day i started get black spots on the material and i was not by anything or doing anything strenuous i took it home and immediately threw it in the wash the dots stayed in the fabric and i could not get them out i am very disappointed that a brand new shirt is now worthless athese are two different parts of the tshirt for the price i cant expect much but these shirts shrink and turn rough after the first wash in other words these shirts are horrible these did not appear to be new or clean all three t shirts were thrown into a mailer and none of them had stickers or tags it was like they were mailed from someone s basement warning these hanes tshirts are itchy and rough disposable 1 day work shirts at best label says cotton but shirts feel like chemically dyed thin burlap shirts are sewn crooked and won t fit properly waste of and time hanes used to produce quality cotton garments jeez now they suck consider yourself warned this t shirt is a tragedy what happened to hanes this was our go to brand arrived and fabric felt rough to the touch so i washed on cold delicate with downey in the rinse and a dryer sheet on low just to fluff before i hung it to dry shrank and still felt scratchy not impressed bye hanes the bargain brand beat you says 100 cotton patent of any kind would be good i seen it in another review and whoever wrote that review was correct feels like very thin burlap stiff as a board love these shirts so thick and made with quality material i bought them a couple sizes bigger because they barely fit when i ordered them in my size last time however they were entirely too big this time but i still love them great price not true to size at all i ordered big not tall when will these companies learn that they are not the same thing small thru the middle when they re normally very roomy huge armhole openings that come down to elbows short sleeve length is actually 3 4 between elbows and wrists shirt itself comes close to knees n nwhat happened to hanes quality trust in this company gone never again if i d wanted a dress i d have ordered from the womens dept n nif you re not at least 6 4 and don t have an extremely long torso and gorilla length arms save yourself the aggravation and pass on this shirt i started wearing my husband s hane s cotton tagless short sleeve tee s during my second trimester and decided to pick up some of my own they are breathable and comfortable and the perfect length while they work perfectly for maternity wear they will also work well post baby bump with a pair of leggings or as a sleep shirt you just can t go wrong with 100 cotton t shirts prices are good my orders have been correct and arrived on the day hanes specified so far i have managed to find really good sale prices on everything from shorts to shirts as a former screen printer and print shop owner i know the quality hanes has provided since the 1990 s the comb cotton hanes beefy tee is the softest and warmest tee shirt i have ever found i have worn hanes tshirts for many years and have never had a problem with mis sizing but this shirt even though i got the size i usually buy from hanes it felt tight and uncomfortable on me the fabric itself was sort of stiff feeling which i believe was what contributed to the too tight sensation i didn t want to wash the shirt 20 times before it finally felt comfortable however so i just got rid of it i have been looking for this color shirt since forever im a female im 5 ft and about 110 pounds i wanted an oversized look and reading the reviews people said to size up im usually a xs s in tops but i got a 3xl big mistake i should ve went with an xl so if your small like me i would suggest getting a xl or even a large overall this tee is nice really nice basic cotton t shirt it s offered at an amazing price and was easy to send out to my friend during quarantine time this is a very nice blue color not a big fan the cotton is quite thick which is kind of nice but it has zero give to it don t care for the fit i prefer the blended materials that have some give so that it fits to your body more these do not i ordered t shirts in 2x for my husband who is bed ridden they are definitely true to size great quality and launder beautifully would definitely recommend hanes products,women's clothing,0
363,S2 Sportswear Women's 2-Pack Active Full Length High-Waist Leggings with Pockets,8.0,4.1,53.0,very good compression a great find decent for the price returned them too small thumbs down runs a bit small but great leggings so far so good order up 1sz if you have a tummy silky feel fabulous price very high waisted nice,if you re looking for compression these are amazing especially for the price they re very comparable to fabletics the major differences i saw in them though was they re a little more in the shiny side and they re just a tiny bit see through but for the price they re worth it got 2xl and it is definitely compression difficult to get in but fits well and snug finally some workout pants that wont ride down wheb i jog going to order more i brought these for my grand daughter and they fit her like a glove the fact that they had a pocket was a plus she said they were perfect the price made them perfect for me also i am 100 satisfied with this product reasonable price perfect for wear for work leggings with 2 side pockets these are not bad at all for the price since my needs are simple it meets my expectations i just needed something to sweat in with a little compression i sized down the material isnt the comfiest but since i m only working out in them it isn t a big deal overall i would recommend the leggings were very nice other than the fact that the seem was unraveling on one of the pairs of leggings i was not very happy with these i ended up returning them they are super tight i was able to get them on but it was not comfortable there was excess space in the crotch and if i pulled on the legs so the material came up then it was even more uncomfortable it also bunched up behind my knees when i would bend they are a thick material which would be nice for cold weather they have a pocket on both legs but it is pretty high up so may look awkward if you had things in the pockets i was all around pretty displeased with these they did stay up well though since it was so tight at the top just not for me i ordered an xl in these and they are probably a size medium i won t be fitting into these anytime soon you get what you pay for i guess first of all these are ridiculously high waisted like they almost pull up to right under my busy and i am 5 10 also they will not stay put i m constantly pulling them up and they are so baggy and weird in the crotch area definitely returning them not even worth the 7 also i know i m tall but because i have to pull them up so far to make then stay which they don t anyway they re super ahorrm almost capris ok quality but as soon as u start jog or exercise it will just roll down not happy with the purchase really nice and a good thick material it is a tighter fit and maybe runs slightly small still good leggings should have gotten a size bigger but very comfortable so far so good i ve only worn twice so time will tell but for the price they look great if you have a tummy i d order a size up quality material and sewing liked the color but pants were very small will have to give them away i wanted this for xl women i gave them to my thin grandaughter i loved em stretchy but gently form fitting great fabric very high waisted awesome price for the price these are great leggings cute but run small i would encourage you to order a size larger as described exceptional material,women's clothing,0

371,"Hanes Men's and Big Men's Premium Beefy-T Long Sleeve T-Shirt, Up To 3XL",8.5,4.3,3021.0,hem came apart a cuff not so happy in the purchased stained shirt misleading colors hole in the armpit during first wear horrible quality no more buying hanes due to inconsistent sizing super low quality adult beefy t long sleeve beefy t s not so beefy comments on the 2x shirts i received great lounge tee bigger than expected inconsistent sizing of beefy t s long sleeve tee shirt tags sigh hanes beefy t shirts website photos do not accurately represent color my favorite shirt nice but small,i love these long sleeve t shirts however the first one i wore came apart at the seam in the cuff area otherwise they are great i just hope the others don t fall apart thanks i like the material however it shrinks when you washed the color was bright it actually different in person and in the photo very upset not only did the delivery keep lying and daying i would be receiving at the end of the day it was more like at the end of the week then i get 3 shirts of the same color and one with stains that looks like it has been stepped on i understand that due to covid 19 the delivery is backed up but don t lie and keep saying at the end of the day i also wash my clothes before wearing but thats no excuse to step on it before packing it up for shipping great material good quality and perfect fit i purchased 10 of these beefy t s for a group event i ordered them in blue horizon which is a sort of teal blue but they came as a much lighter shade of blue they look nothing alike and there isn t another color option that even looks close to this shade unfortunately it s too close to our event to return and wait for a replacement on the upside the shirts fit true to size and are comfortable thus the 2 stars my husband wore one of the 7 long sleeve beefy shirts i recently bought for him online and he literally had a hole in the armpit seem within an hour of wearing the first one hoping they all aren t like that bought this a few days ago just arrived recently to be exact a day before this review to start the softness is hardly as described for one this is rather stiff and scratchy if that makes sense and for something to be beefy it s super thin just as thin as a standard shirt going on to how the quality of the product is upon opening the package i noticed a giant hole on the back upper shoulder area don t know what s going on in the hati factory but this is beyond bad money well wasted on this am going to stop buying hanes products due to the inconsistency in sizes i have worn a large for many years these were perfect when i tried them on finally long enough but once i washed them they were too small i am not going to pay to return something that i cannot count on to fit co only last for a day and there is a hole in the pits it seems like the seams were not sewn properly this shirt is so misshaped the upper body of the shirt is huge the sleeves are uneven one longer than the other it narrows down to where it is cut very slim hence it is un wearable hanes you lost my business bought a bunch a tee shirts 2 years ago loved them bought 8 more last week they weigh half as much as they used too very thin what a disappointment the sizing proportion and style were completely off i normally wear a women s 2x and specifically ordered these shirts because i had another hanes 2x that fit me perfectly these were cut for a man about 6 ft tall the quality and softness of the cotton was good i bought three of three of these t shirts for myself to wear with leggings and sweatpants inside the house i thought since these were men s sizing i should go with the small but the small is much more fitted than i expected if you re looking to buy for similar purposes be sure to size up aside from the learning curve on the sizing it s a great thick well constructed t shirt bigger then expected i am a fairly petite person at 5 foot hundred pounds and i ordered the smallest shirt they had it was pretty baggy on me not a big deal as i ll be wearing it as an undershirt for work although i have washed it twice now and it s still extremely stiff my issue is inconsistent sizing i ordered beefy t s in large which i had ordered before and they fit properly and they were too short particularly in the sleeves this time i ordered xl thinking the sizes might have changed they were too large ordered it was not told until shipping it was not available that was the one i really wanted good long sleeve t shirt with a slight annoyance these have two dangly tags on the inside of the collar at the back of course i find these distracting and annoying since so many t shirts are tagless even other hanes t shirts it seems anachronistic to have these dangly tags otherwise good t shirt with good fit i returned the shirts they are not the tagless shirts that i have become accustomed to in recent years they are now made of a lighter weight material than my beefy t shirts have been made in the past i e no longer beefy evidently this is a new standard for hanes beefy t s there were other differences also i was very disappointed the shirt is soft but the color was all wrong we ordered turquoise blue horizon and received a very light colored shirt not a good color for my husband to wear to the job site wish they made the color as shown instead of a pastel version of the color we purchased 3 shirts definitely not satisfied with the purchase he won t wear them as a woman with apparently freakishly long arms it is hard to find a long sleeve shirt that is actually long sleeved and i found them here in the men s department the sleeves are nice and long and the shirt fits nicely doesn t make bulky like some other men s shirts do nthe material is pleasantly thin good for cooler summer evenings and excellent for layering ni m one happy camper it wasn t clear when i purchased them if the sizing was men s or women s so i assumed men s they are fine but i like my tees pretty loose and these are definitely more snug than i usually purchase i ll be buying these again just in a larger size,women's clothing,0
372,Just My Size Women's Plus Size Fleece Pullover Sweatshirt,12.35,4.0,648.0,comfy but a bit fitted oh so comfy shrinkage size crewneck sweatshirt hanes sweatshirt very disappointing too small best store to shop sizing nice but runs a bit small nice sweatshirt order up a size fleece sweatshirt good for price runs small great love this comfy cozy sweatshirt good fit and weight,this sweatshirt is very soft and comfortable its warm and cozy without the usual heaviness of sweatshirts something to keep in mind i sized up with this sweatshirt and feel like if i bought my true size it would have been form fitting i assumed this would have more of the oversized sweatshirt look and feel but it runs more form fitting this is the first time i have bought this brand in several years not that i didn t like the brand but my just didn t need to be replaced the quality of the sweatshirt for the price is good but the weight of the material is not the same as the old ones i have everything about the new one is great but i wish the weight of the fleece was heavier this is a very comfortable sweat shirt i even where it out when i go shopping the prices are higher than last year when i bought my first one only about 5 00 more not too bad worth buying it if your looking for a shirt that s comfortable and warm i ordered according to the size chart measurements took my body measurements runs big but it s so comfortable the only downside i feel is that it doesn t have that sweatshirt stretch it rides up but other than that i love it it shrinks badly had i known i d have gotten it even bigger but it s so soft too even though i ordered a size bigger than i usually wear the sweatshirts were smaller than i expected i like sweats to be big and comfy but these were nearly too small i will wear them for everyday but the sleeves are snug and they were short in length i ordered two sweatshirts same size one fit perfectly the other feels like a size smaller even though it s marked the same as the other shirt the arms are too tight when i opened it i could tell immediately the arms looked too skinny for the shirt and the overall fit is tight disappointing they need better quality control

only did i have to deal with my disappointment i now had to facilitate the return this is the fourth time i have ordered items through walmart and have had similar issues walmart needs to procure more reliable vendors this sweatshirt is soft and has nice material but it is very small if you order this you best go up one full size because i ordered my regular size and it is too tight the arms are very tight i am sorry i purchased this and washed it already quality products best that can be bought you will be completely satisfied you will be glad you shopped there thought i was getting the

this is a 1x it fits like a large though that being said it is very comfortable soft and long enough to fit to my hip i really like this sweatshirt these are easy sweat shirts soft warm and easy to

website i bought the pink and purple nthey are soft hardly shrunk in dryer pretty true to size runs small order up a size i typically wear a 2x but i want my sweatshirt to be loose and comfy so i ordered a size larger the 3x was small on my arms just what i needed a simple plain sweatshirt for around the house and if if becomes stained at that great price no big deal it s sized appropriately and the comfy material is of great quality i bought three to go with the two i bought previously because they are perfect during this time of home isolation for covid19 the shirts fit me well i am short and round and like loose fits so it works it s not too long and loose enough around the waist that it doesn t bind the sleeves aren t too long and the weight is a good medium i wear sweats all winter and wanted these to paint holiday designs on they work well for that i would have given it five stars but am disappointed in the very limited color choices wish they had a red green and

pandemic i only carry my driver license and maybe one debit card and i feel safe with them in that zip pocket first 2 pairs l ordered in my normal size made the mistake of just washing them first in of trying them on as it turns out they were actually too big but l kept them anyway ordered another pair but smaller this time and they fit perfect great buy love this set don t hesitate and buy these scrubs i bought scrubstar and figs scrubs to try out and found out scrubstar actually fit me better except the length of the pants overall than figs and it s about 1 4 of the price for reference i am 5 11 155lbs usually a small medium amazing pants and they are the perfect length for me i m 5 8 and the regular length is right where i need them to be very cute with the matching top or change around the colors these by far have been the best purchase ever i own them in every color comfortable stretch and they move with you i love them yes buy them i bought 3 sets of scrubs and i love them they slide right on and feel great all day my coworkers even commented on how nice they are and the fabric is so nice i can t say enough about how nice they are i definitely plan on buying more my daughter wears this for her uniform pants at a grocery chain she likes the ability to put her phone in one of the pockets along with other items throughout the day she also likes the comfort and flexibility of the fabric as she is moving around a lot the waist in them is to tight if i go up one size the pants are still tight inthe waist and are way longer then the right size which is still a little long only has one side pocket it is small and when i try to pull my phone out the pocket turns inside out i do love the material they re made of though i ordered the radiant red color due to its image being a raspberry colored pant that could match with several of my scrub tops what was sent was orange pants apart from false advertising the pants are amazing fit just misleading i typically wear figs and am big fig fan but it s so hot in the az summer going into people s homes and driving alot especially with full ppe so i bought a pair of these and they are amazing lightweight great stretch washes well true to size breathes liquid resistant affordable loved so much i bought a bunch of colors one pair for every day of the week i get lots if compliments from coworkers and clients i m athletic build 5 5 165lbs and purchased medium top and bottoms highly recommend cant stop raving nice colors especially the royal blue plenty of pocket room not the usual women s useless pockets look great on and feel great perfectly comfortable favorite pants spring summer fall definitely not for outside in winter wished they were a bit cheaper than 18 pair in 2019 but worth the price machine washable don t fade and also easy to hand wash dry quick bought three pair blue black charcoal gray i m 5 2 110 size xs petite fits just right perfect length no high water look the size small are too long by several inches these pants fit perfectly i am so glad i ordered these bigger as with all my stomach surgeries make it hard to wear certain style pants jeans are the hardest pant for me to wear so that is why i thought i would try scrubs guess what yes you are right they fit me perfectly they do not bind in the waist or legs they feel like silk so soft and do not bind ordering the pants a few sizes too big so they will be perfect suuuper soft i bought these together with the top of course i bought a size small because i have chicken legs lol i am 5 2 and 123lbs and no hips so the small fit perfectly still with room if you have fuller hips and thighs and want a fitted look then i think small would still be okay i love the elastic waistband you have to look at the specifics when purchasing this item online it has to say scrubstar performance it also says either 360 stretch or 4 way stretch becasue there are a lot of scrubstar ones that has different clothing materials this specific one i fell in love once i saw it at our local store i couldn t believe how sofffttt it was lol but didnt have my size so i had to order online these scrub pants are awesome i needed these in a petite size because i am 5 2 i am 110 lbs so i got the xs and they fit great length was perfect the material is smooth and soft very comfortable the elastic around the waist is comfortable as well and happy that they have a drawstring also these are such a good value i would recommend to anyone needing comfortable functional inexpensive scrubs these are so lightweight and comfortable im 5 ft 8 in tall and these are the perfect length i typically wear a 16w and the xl fit great i love that the have standard slide in pockets and zippered pockets and elastic loops so versatile highly recommend the elastic goes all the way around the pants as well as the pull string to make the waist the fit tighter the pants come all the way up and covers my behind not like other uniform pants with elastic only in the front and the tie string does nothing the material is soft to touch the pants stretch with me and they are comfortable the quality is good i ve purchased another pair of pants and plan on purchasing the top hoping the top fits as well i typically wear figs and am big fig fan but it s so hot in the az summer going into people s homes and driving alot especially with full ppe so i bought a pair of these and they are amazing lightweight great stretch washes well true to size breathes liquid resistant affordable loved so much i bought a bunch of colors one pair for every day of the week i get lots if compliments from coworkers and clients i m athletic build 5 5 165lbs and purchased medium top and bottoms highly recommend cant stop raving the only reason i gave 4stars is i like two cargo pockets and these just have one i love em great material fits perfect i got a medium that fits amazing i ordered a large because i usually go oversized but again the medium fit great perfect length with slits so the hang over shoes i am 5 5 160 for reference love these pants these pants are very comfortable and the front pocket is nice and deep perfect for holding exam gloves the little

from this happy address these are just amazing i got them as i was running low on my normal black undies and these couldn t have done a better job at replacing them these fit well and go high enough to smooth out the lumps and bumps and the coverage under your pants shorts etc is great i truly love these the description briefs means they should go up to the waist these do not they fall below the waist which is really uncomfortable if i wanted them below the waist i would order something else not happy with this fit the elastic is much more slender than before also the company trying to save money on materials does not make the product more attractive they say size 10 but fit like size 9 they need to be a bit bigger and looser on the legs the pants themselves feel good and i hope they last a long time i purchased these to wear after giving birth to my son they always say get a size bigger and high waist to hold everything in for reference i am 5 9 and at the time i was 255 lbs with a swollen stomach and legs bottom heavy normally wear a 16 18 and xl in undies they were way too tight on my legs and i bought a size 10 n nfast forward to now 11 weeks postpartum and they fit comfortably i m now 232 and a size 16 they are really high and cover my whole but the leg holes feel a little tight when i put them on but i just stretch it out with my hand and i m good they don t ride up which is nice definitely granny parties i bought two separate pkgs one was all white 10 pack made in thailand the fit is terrible not what i expected at all the other pack was the same size and style assorted colors 6 pack made in vietnam they fit fine i have been buying hanes briefs for years i do not recommend any that are made in thailand horrible worst underwear purchase ever not 1 pair wear sewn correctly every waistband only partially attached hardly any stretch to fabric ill fitting too not worth it hanes off my shopping list i ve been buying hanes briefs for years and have been very happy until now these are nothing like the previous ones they are too short the elastic is rigid 2 pairs torn at the second wear the fabric doesn t stretch and they roll at the waist a big disappointment very small very rigid material no stretch unfortunately i bought 5 packages and washed them before i tried them they are several sizes smaller compared to the ones i bought a few years ago during the past several years i switched to cacique and love those ones now i thought i should try hanes again they lowered the quality and size and are absolutely useless i cannot wear them and i cannot return them since i washed them a 75 total loss not sure good will would take them they are nothing like the ones you buy in the stores when i buy them in the store they are thicker material these are thin you can poke a hole in them with your finger nail and they are not soft at all i will never buy them online again not worth the money they also roll down i wear a 6 8 in pants and i got these in large as i wanted to be sure not tight or showing seams or binding these are horrible the binding around the legs is the kind that doesn t stretch already washed them which is a bummer if i got in a medium no way would these be at all wearable so now i got auden brand medium at target and perfect fit i usually like cotton but these even after washing are stiff like there is a fabric sizing in the material ni m thinking i will be tossing all these very comfortable and fit me well if you like cotton underwear these briefs are the best i have found they wash and wear well also these are similar to the ones i always buy these are not as good a quality as past purchase but the price was ok they are comfortable but i don t expect them to last all that long they are 100 cotton so whatever your normal size if you may want to order a size up the quality is impeccable will order again but probably a size larger not made the same anymore material is thin and the sizing is not consistent i think they are irregular will not order from here again there are better options these are not full cut briefs as i was expecting they were inexpensive and the fabric and cut reflects that they re skimpy i plan to return them and shop elsewhere i ordered a size 9 which is the size ive ordered or purchased for awhile these came but the sizing is all different on them some fit as expected but many of them are tight in the leg area and some fall short of being a brief i was very disappointed in these briefs they were not true to size i can barely wear them i had just bought a bag of just my size briefs and they fit perfectly i measured myself and bought according to the size chart the jms were perfect the hanes briefs are too small these cotton panties value package are a must have fit well very comfortable and come out of the laundry just fine i used to just wear them occasionally but now they are my go to while in this pandemic quarantine i am finding myself wearing leggings and a t shirt during the day and pajamas at night so what better panties are there to pair with casual comfy hanes that s it so happy to have found them here at walmart while the underwear itself is good the sizing is not i usually wear a 2x with occasionally a 1x i ordered the size for a 3x to make sure it was big enough but it is too small for me i will hold onto it in case i can get down to that size but in the meantime i need to look for something else that will work now,women's clothing,0
375,Athletic Works Women's Plus Size Dri More Relaxed Fit Sweatpants,15.98,4.5,1007.0,very very nice good work pants great fit dressy or casual perfect for every day love the fit and they are so comfortable my favorite pants these pants are long but comfy total comfort comfy good long lounge pants get a few pairs you ll love them i wouldn t describe these as sweatpants great but not sweatpants not bad pretty much what i was looking for these are long pants but comfy draw string is too thin wish i knew about these before now not sweatpants but okay,i love these pants i bought them because i wanted something loose and cool to walk in i always worry about length because i have a 31 inseam so i ordered a size larger than usual since they don t carry tall and they fit perfectly everywhere they are very soft and wash up nicely i never put my pants in the dryer because one inch shorter and i can t wear them the washing instructions suggest to hang dry anyway i was a bit worried about the quality since they are really low price but they are as nice as the yoga pants i practically live in that cost me 50 so i hope that tells you a lot about the great quality i bought 3 pair of these for my daughter to work in shes an essentual worker she has much responsibility she can move and stretch and lift in these she says they are cool and wick away sweat while shes working these are great finally a pair that reminds me of the danskin pairs i had from a couple of years ago they are nice and long and did not shrink at all in the dryer i have thrown out all my others that look like i am waiting for a flood good fit i have trouble finding these that are long enough for my long legs these are perfect for my 33 inseam so comfortable i wear a pair of these every day i ordered 2 pair of these pants they are so comfortable the only thing i noticed is they are a little bit to long as to the size they are perfect i would highly recommend buying this pants i plan to order more in the near future ok so first off i hope you dont want sweatpants because you wont be happy they changed the description however i have bought these before and they are super comfy i wear them like all the time they fit great and wash very well i bought them last year and they ran out so i plan on ordering more i just wish they had more colors i purchased these to wear around the house i m 5 7 and they are too long in me i washed and dried them they shrunk a little but i will wash them in hot next time in the meantime i have to roll the waistband over twice to make sure i m not walking in the hem nthey are comfortable have pockets which is a huge plus definitely straight leg giving you plenty of room because of the tie waist basically a shoestring you may consider buying a size smaller these pants are so comfortable and long enough not all heavy women are short it is so hard to find women s pants with an inseam longer than 28 inches i absolutely love these only problem is they are much longer then usual as i normally have to get bigger sizes to have the length on the 2x i would say the length has inseam of 36 38 i m a 33 and have to put below my bra to keep them from dragging on floor these pants are super comfortable as the draw string around the waist allows you to control how tight they are there i bought a next size up because they were to be worn after an abdominal surgery when i couldnt wear my other pants my only disappointment with them is they are very long i am short at 5ft 3in and they wrap completely under my feet and still have a few inches extra since im not going anywhere right now i just fold them up at the bottom and will hem them later they serve their purpose for now these are seriously the best i m always worried buying online but the reviews were all great i went ahead and about two paid i need more now they are so comfy that you could wear them to the gym or just during the day out and about i was worried about size but even the 3x has a jaw string which gives lots of room for losing weight and still being able to use them for awhile can t wait to get more of these i m a leggings girl and i rather be wearing these i used to always buy danksins and was so unhappy when wal mart stopped selling them i was thrilled to find these and have bought several more since my only complaint is that there are more shades colors to chose from i knew these would be very long because i am only 5 2 i had to shorten them 4 inches but that is okay they are not the fleecy type of sweatpants i m used to they are a much thinner material and very soft but i wouldn t describe them as sweatpants i must say i didn t realize the legs would be so wide if you can remember palazzo pants they are super wide like palazzo pants i will wear them at home and be comfortable but would never wear these wide legged pants in public my pair has a 32 and one half inch inseam so i and others will have to hem them after washing in cold water and putting them in the dryer until damp the inseam remained the same like other reviews said they have the same cut and design as the danskin item from years ago except these have spandex in them which should be nice to keep their shape a little better after several hours of wear the fabric content is 62 cotton 33 polyester and 5 spandex and is slightly lighter weight than the danskins were i still wear my danskin ones and they have worn like iron they are not sweatpants they are a light to medium weight flat knit i like the weight since i run warm i can only hope they last as long as the danskins have i probably shouldn t have gotten the size i got i wear a 24 and bought a 4x its too big but it still fits so im not complaining i love the pockets theyre huge i wish all womens pants had pockets this big not a thick material so probably not great for the winter but im not counting it out yet because theyve kept me pretty warm i ordered these because i am looking for more pants like i already had this is the same company and nearly the same cut the material is probably the same as is the color all in all i m happy i wish it was exactly the same cut because i think the older ones are more flattering but comfort first and that alone makes these a winner they fit perfectly i purchased these to wear around the house i m 5 7 and they are too long in me i washed and dried them they shrunk a little but i will wash them in hot next time in the meantime i have to roll the waistband over twice to make sure i m not walking in the hem nthey are comfortable have pockets which is a huge plus definitely straight leg giving you plenty of room because of the tie waist basically a shoestring you may consider buying a size smaller i love the pants except the draw string it is so thin its more like a wire around your waist than a string i will try to replace it with something thicker if not i wont wear them yes the thin string is that uncomfortable omg these are awesome they are little long for my short legs but a little hemming and they are perfect i m going to get some more they are perfect to wear to work or just laying around the house they re okay i wouldn t call them sweatpants they are a sturdy soft cotton blend the cut is very much like the picture too long and very wide at the ankle,women's clothing,0
376,Time and Tru Women's Stretch Denim Bootcut Jeans,16.87,4.0,824.0,great fit for more straight up and down figures my favorite jean worth every penny they are jeans what can i say sizing off nice pants midrise not high rise sticky label left dark shadow on pant leg site says high rise but sends mid rise no happy eh not the worst jeans but only eh bootcut and slim fit not true to size love these jeans horrible pants color and feel are great rise is too short upsetting favorite pants perfect amount of stretch great fitting comfortable non skinny jeans,i have a terrible time finding jeans that fit my body for reference i have a a round midsection with 43 inch waist 45 inch hips and 31inch inseam these are super stretchy and close fitting on my thighs rear hips but still big enough to button comfortably in a size 16 im short waisted so the rise hits right at my belly button havent washed them yet but very pleased upon receiving them in the mail and trying them on these might be a little challenging if you have a more hour glass shape with rounder thighs but at this price worth a try plus the pockets are actually high enough on these to be flattering on the tush omg i love these jeans they fit me like a glove and true to size i m a curvy 16 and these are the best jeans i own i want every color in the rainbow in this jean for my wardrobe i am 5 5 around 200 lbs and the 16 fit perfect in length i love that come over my belly button so i don t have a jellyroll look under my shirts and no butt crack showing when you bend over to pick up something i really do love these more than all the name brand expensive jeans i have in my wardrobe i m not normally a reviewer but these jeans are fantastic i have a bit of a tummy from two c sections and these jeans hold my tummy in and don t cut me in two while sitting i was really shocked i m 5 7 150lbs and the size 10 was perfectly snug and just the right length totally going to buy another pair the only downfall is they stretch a little too much by the end of the day but nothing a wash won t fix i would not recommend these jeans for pear shaped figured women who have a small waist and full hips but us apples shapes have found a new favorite pair of go to jeans this is a new brand for me since walmart changed over from the faded glory brand i loved that brand they fit so well these fit about the same and wash well i like the wash finish so i will keep purchasing them i should be a size 6 from the chart i bought this in the store in blue jean 6 and khaki jean 8 they re still too small the 8 was skin tight and barely buttoned fingers crossed that a 10 might fit i d say order up about 2 sizes the material is thick with a slight stretch inseam is about 31 5 32 the overall fit seemed promising just way too small i would give these a 5 star if they were highrise as advertised they are not i don t like midrise pants they slide down my curvy body so i m always pulling them up but they are so comfortable and look really good nice and snug but still leaves room for moving around nmy hubs says they look really good also i wearing one pair to see if i can wear them or not depends on how much they ride down not high rise jeans when i opened the package i was sad because the ad says high rise boot cut jeans not sure if i got the wrong ones or if the description is written wrong but the tag clearly says mid rise i only chose these because im high waisted and they are hard to find otherwise im sure they are ok they didn t fit like a true high rise jean a bit lower on the waist the worst thing about them is the sticky size tag that ran down the leg when removed it left the shadow of it on the pant tried washing but it s still there i will try washing one more time if it doesn t come off i ll return the pants i ordered these from here because they said high rise when i received it it was mid rise i returned them thinking it was a mistake i ordered them again and received a mid rise again i love this jeans in high rise they fit like a glove and i can t find them at any of the stores i wish i would have purchase a few when i found them at the store great pair of jeans but there seems to be an issue with walmart putting it on the site as a high rise when it is not what they are sending you say they are high rise on your web site but they are only mid rise asked for an exchange and same mid rise sent love them they feel great and fit just perfectly to my curves i m an odd length between petite and regular surprisingly they fit perfectly not to long or too short i am between 12 14 usually i know that i m good with 14 but these are still snug in the waist umff they are also a bit highwater i m 5 7 and they are not to my ankles i will keep but not buy again they are slim fit bootcut which it slim it was in the description of the jeans i would have bought one size bigger and would have loved them n ni mean i can get them one but i can t breath does not fit true to size they run small they also took a week longer to get here than the other brand i bought i love the way they fit they contour to my body not to thick not to thin they stretch just right horribly uncomfortable bought these to wear at work because other jeans i have from the same brand are great but these just suck they re tight in weird places and are not high wasted this was the first result that came up for high wasted jeans when i searched so i figured they would be as soon as i find the tags that came with them they re getting returned i have several pairs of time and tru pants that fit great but this was the first time i purchased a pair of time and tru jeans i really liked the color and feel of these jeans however they fit more like low rise jeans on me therefore i am returning them and will be looking for something with a higher rise to them the title on the listing and the title on the item do not match i get time and try pants all the time i have never ordered them off line though i wear a size 18p and they did not have them in that size so i up sized and thought i d just wear a belt with them nnope ni can hardly button these i was so upset bc i love them they are so comfy and the perfect length for me i will be sending them back these are my favorite pants im on my second pair ive had my first pair for about 2 years and wanted a second pair perfect amount of stretch i hope they never stop selling these id be lost without them love these new jeans just the right rise length and fit would buy again and would recommend for a friend i return everything i find the smallest fault with but these are staying in my closet,women's clothing,0
377,"Fruit of the Loom Women's Comfort Front Close Sports Bra, Style 96014",9.94,4.3,1901.0,i love it might have gone a size smaller but soft and comfortable comfortable and so soft soft and so comfortable great comfortable sports bra soft and so comfortable very nice sports bra pay attention to the price pleasantly surprised might go a size smaller but they work well pleased comfortable cool bra perfect no padding bad fit this one shrunk after washing it once a really comfortable bra,i read the other comments and some said it ran small and to go up a size or two im a 36 and the first one i ordered a 40 it wasn t big nor small but fit but the straps was kinda loose on my shoulders the next one i ordered was 38 which fits perfectly on me i love this bra it fits me perfectly and it s comfortable after having a baby my boobs don t sit up like they used to but this bra holds everything in place of course this is not a push up bra so my boobs are not perky but they look natural if that makes sense i also love that i can wear it with all of the claps hooked together or i can just hook the bottom few clasps together and leave the top open i love this bra so much more than my regular bras i will definitely purchase again fighting shoulder impingement and pulling my usual sporty bra types over the head with arms up was getting difficult thought i d try these and so happy i did makes getting dressed much easier now i might stitch up the shoulders a bit so they fit a bit more snug but i haven t done that yet so it s not a big deal snap front is actually a snap to put together and undo as well washing up very well good purchase for me and my needs these bras are just what i was looking for so comfortable inexpensive there is not much support so i have to do a bit of adjustment when i put them on but that doesn t bother me i wouldn t wear them for running but they re great for walking and everyday activities i ve washed them twice and they are still good i love these bras i love them so much i ordered 3 so far all in different colors its hard to find a comfortable bra for me that comfortable and has some support along with being able to fasten securely and easily they are so soft it fits perfectly and the most important thing is that its comfortable i wear this bra as an everyday bra they are not expensive with is great and fit right into my budget i will definately be buying more i love these bras i love them so much i ordered 3 so far all in different colors its hard to find a comfortable bra for me that comfortable and has some support along with being able to fasten securely and easily they are so soft it fits perfectly and the most important thing is that its comfortable i wear this bra as an everyday bra they are not expensive with is great and fit right into my budget i will definately be buying more absolutely love these bras i have a shoulder issue so trying to take off a standard pull over sports bra after working out and sweating was near impossible these front closures are ideal for my situation im n5 foot 5 inches tall and weigh 145 lbs and normally wear a size 36c bra i ordered a size 38 in these bras and they are the perfect size highly recommend i washed in cold on gentle and they did not shrink i did hang to dry rather than putting in the dryer perfect bra if you need or prefer front closures i dont think id wear these for anything other than exercising though i love these bras i love them so much i ordered 3 so far all in different colors its hard to find a comfortable bra for me that comfortable and has some support along with being able to fasten securely and easily they are so soft it fits perfectly and the most important thing is that its comfortable i wear this bra as an everyday bra they are not expensive with is great and fit right into my budget i will definately be buying more this sports bra is comfortable attractive and easy to get in and out of with the front closure the front ruching helps to keep everything in place the u shaped back keeps the straps from slipping off my shoulders and the shoulder straps are a nice wide width adding more support the high sides help to smooth under the arms and the back area the breathable cotton fabric makes it soft and comfortable and the spandex helps it to keep its shape i like how it s machine washable in cold water even though it s okay to put into the dryer i just hang mine on a hanger to air dry not wanting it to shrink i m a 40d size and would recommend sizing up i have one size 42 and one size 44 i failed to notice that there were options of sellers on this item i ordered the more expensive option by mistake the only complaint is the price had i paid attention i could have gotten it for less than half than i paid that being said the seller got back to me quickly when i wanted to return it after having tried it on it is comfortable so i intend to keep it and will try to pay closer attention to the prices and sellers next time the item came in and i was really disappointed it seemed flimsy and i was worried it would work as well as a cami when i finally tried the item i loved it the only reason i am giving it 4 stars is because it could be a little thicker that aside i love this bra it has become my favorite one to wear fighting shoulder impingement and pulling my usual sporty bra types over the head with arms up was getting difficult thought i d try these and so happy i did makes getting dressed much easier now i might stitch up the shoulders a bit so they fit a bit more snug but i haven t done that yet so it s not a big deal snap front is actually a snap to put together and undo as well washing up very well good purchase for me and my needs this is now one of my most favorite sports bra it is super comfy and easy to get on and off it has a front close but i have found if you prefer not to undo it everytime it s easy to pull on and off as well they have a variety of colors and great price this bra is not padded hopefully this color bra is as comfortable as the sand color i ordered previously as it is so comfortable to wear around home when working or resting this bra is very soft and comfortable there is a little show through but it is double layers so it is minimal because of the hooks in front it doesn t have the uniboob look it fit very well there s no padding in the bras and it s suppose to be there i order these for my mom and they were nice but once i order some for myself in a smaller size they have no padding and i thought it was a pack ni payed 20 for one stupid bra with no padding very upset about this ndont waste your money im a dd cup and this is just not made for that however if you are younger like pre children this may work out for you on the model you can see distinct separation between the breasts on me both boobs were pressed together skin to skin uni boob also i didnt like the front hooks a pain will go for front zipper next time with more support the material was nice and i could have worn it all day i m keeping it and will only wear it at home for exercise or housework embarrassed to wear in public would not buy again buy it wear it once wash it and dry it once and it will be so tight it will be even hard to breath for some reason out of allllll the bras that i have purchased over 20 years of my life this particular one shrinks so much that it s unwearable just washed and dried it once and it shrank so much that it s basically a waste of money i wash and dry all my sprots bras and never had this problem before ever i hand wash and hang dry all my wired bras and machine wash and dry my sports bras this one is made or chemically treated in a way that it just shrinks bad can t possibly wear it i would have to suddenly be an a cup in order to wear this without the pain it shrunk that much can t do it and also i like to breath it fit perfect when i bought it but now not at all hummmn weird i love the fit and the feel the front hook design works well i will have breast cancer surgery next week this will be my after surgery bra and long after the surgery is done,women's clothing,0
378,"Fit for Me Women's Plus Underwear Assorted Heather Briefs, 6-Pack",30.34,4.5,459.0,comfort and full coverage great underwear 6 to a package great 100 cottounderwear wish the price was less very good quality product good fit not so hot on the colors ugly waistband great leg rubber uncovered skin sliced very dissatisfied and disappointed rip after one wash wear not the same as use to be panty best underwear ever there ok but they make them smaller then regular comfy fit omg great product leg rubber not covered irritates skin bad choice good buy great,i ve been wearing this brand of underwear for years i normally buy it at walmart but they haven t had my size in stock for a while i like that this brand style has full coverage and a wide comfortable waistband they stand up to many washings too i have purchased dozens of underwear and finally found these that are wonderful they are a full brief meaning up to the belly button if i am going to wear underwear then i want them to be full not little thongs that cut you know where if you wear tight pants this underwear does not show any ridges what a great surprise i ordered 2 packs of 3 and got 2 packs of 6 each for the same price these panties are the best ive only worn this brand for decades they fit better than any other ive tried only problem being they are so popular stock can be short no rising comfortable cotton comfortable waist band as long as these are available i will only wear this style of fruit of the loom plus size in stock and they fit of course if i could have gone to the store they would have been much cheaper but for the older fat and immuno compromised the risk of contracting covid 19 is not worth it for a few dollars the expense of a hospital stay the cost of additional immuney system boosting supplements nebulizer treatments and covid after effects are just too much and that s if you live these underwear were more than i expected in quality price and construction they were almost flawless to me love these products these fit my big butt and wide hips plus a bit of belly overhang pretty well happy they come in large sizes no fit problems the leg holes are medium not too big or too small just that the colors well i prefer skin tones and basics and earth tones not really these rainbow types of colors i got purple blue etc but it s so much better than having to deal with poor fitting ones they are comfy ugly the colors are ugly the greys look like white that had been washed with dk blues and came out looking like dirty water thank god nobody will see these under my clothes the package shows one thing but the inside shows ugly very thin matierial bands reminds me of husbands briefs the colors are nice and the top band doesn t roll but the leg elastic is a strip of rubber that isn t fully covered by the cotton fabric and it cut into my skin and caused horrible irritation it did not get better after repeated washing will have to wear inside out or i just ordered other underwear size was not what the size that i was expecting i was given the wrong cotton briefs the wrong size the wrong color and the package was torn you can tell that the first pair of briefs had been taken out and placed back in the package moreover i am upset that whomever picked the order did not bother to read the description of this order also now i have to make another trip to the store just to get my money back how annoying is this first time wearing after wash hole at elastic band and hip seam why is it so hard to find quality products these days i don t hold out much hope for the other 5 pair disappointed have always bought this brand this time material is not as good and started getting holes after n2nd wearing some fit just right and some were to big i ll wait on buying these for a while i bought this item was not satisfied because when i received the item it was suppose to be 6 colors in the package and i was sent 2 colors only light purple and dark purple if that was all they had they should of notified me before the items were sent i purchased 2 packages so now i have all purple underwear will not be ordering from them again these are the only panties i will wear i have a big belly small butt so panties always roll down well these dont i didnt think it was possible to find underwear that didnt roll down my belly lol but i finally found these and so happy i gave them a chance they are amazing light weight no tags dont ride up your butt dont roll down i promise you will love these although you might not get the colors that it shows you in the picture i didnt get the black pair with white dots i got 2 dark gray 2 pink 1 purple 1 light gray nothing like the colors on the box but i dont mind there ok but you have to order a large size then you normally wear cause made smaller then they use to be made i know these will always fit perfectly this has been my go to brand for years the delivery was slow so i ll probably purchase in a store in the future these panties are the perfect fit for me i m 5 7 at 295 lbs and i ordered the size 11 they fit above my navel likevi like them to and they dont roll down i also love the colors i will be buying more waistband id nice non roll leg rubber isn t fully covered and caused skin irritation and actually cut into my flesh will never by again and have to wear them inside out to protect skin just ordered the breathable ones that have fully covered leg elastic i do not like the white fabric in the crotch but the fit is great they should make the crotch the same color as the rest of the pant this is my first time buying this brand and i will stick with them for as long as walmart sells them they are perfect,women's clothing,0

380,Secret Treasures Women’s and Women’s Plus Superminky Robe,21.73,4.8,290.0,cute pretty cozy women robe worth it cute bargain comfy and warm soft plush robe worth the buy superminky robe yaaaaaaaaaaaassssss very soft and cozy robe in awe with a robe comfy cozy and soft soft really great all the way around handy coverup with many uses around the house i don t like it maybe someone else will super soft cancer comfort robe wine heart fusion is super cute but color bled thin plush robe,this robe is soft pretty and warm typically i wear a size large in this brand but i wanted a bigger size because a looser fitting robe is more comfortable than a tighter fit one i am glad i did order an xl they do seem to run small though even though the xl fits if i would have ordered a large it would have been uncomfortably small i like to wear the robe in the mornings when i first got out of bed and after a shower before i get dressed for the day its so warm and cozy the fur and the material is so soft and snuggly i never really understood bathrobes before i moved to america from the philippines when i did getting out of the shower with a towel is a nightmare here in upstate new york i needed this so bad bc i hate the cold best one yet i thought it was going to be too short im glad i got a x large it s soft and feels good on my body this item is so warm and soft it s the type of rope that you cuddle up in on a cold winter day with a cup of hot chocolate and watch your favorite movie i really mean this i purchased one too large for me by accident but it s okay because for me this robe is like my close friend it hugs me when i put it on with all it s fluffiness and makes me feel good i am 5 8 and 130 lbs and ordered the medium fits perfect and is roomy but not too big this is my second robe from this brand the one im retiring was worn for 4 years i believe and is still as soft as when i bought it i just got tired of looking at it its crazy that a walmart brand is my go to brand for my robe since i wear it often but it is highly recommended i really like this robe and think it is an exceptional value it is well made in really cute designs i purchased two for me the fabric weight is perfect it is cozy but not so thick and stuffy that it doesn t breathe it is soft and a good length as well first off from the pics it looks a lot thicker than what is received but that didn t matter once i put it on and lounged around in it it s super warm and incredibly soft i got a size up from my normal pj size and i m glad i did incredibly happy with this purchase i was concerned the arms would be too long since i m only 5 2 but they fall perfectly take this into account if you re taller with longer arms this robe is soft plush and comfy love the feel of it against my skin its super nice i would def buy it and i bought all the colours i love it so much the quality is by far the best i have seen washes well too without a lot of color bleeding this robe is soooooo soft it really has a luxurious feel to it it s wonderful albeit a little on the thin side but that s ok the softness makes up for the thinness and it s fluffy too it true to size and quality made and it was 21 00 so there s that i would recommend and buy it again lol i absolutely love a comfortable robe and this has been a good addition to my collection it s very soft and not too heavy nonly cons are i generally prefer robes to be a bit longer and also i prefer the patch pockets over the inseam style pockets noverall it s been a great go to robe and it s very comfortable soft long warm everything you need in a robe minus the hood bought a xl although i wear a large but thank goodness i did i snuggle in it luke a blanket 5 2 and 180 lbs omg fast shipping and packaged very well it s exactly as the pic and so soft and keeps me warm my house is usually kinda cool all year round thank you so much nice and soft the only drawback is the fluffy collar and wristbands get matted down after 6 months and need brushing with a wire dog brush to bring back the soft fluffy pile i love this robe super soft really warm without being heavy great length i m 5 7 and wear 12 14 jeans and have lots a room in the 2x size and the price is fantastic i found myself frequently getting cold this is perfect for throwing on when the house feels drafty or to take a pet outside at night over lighter inside wear clothing very soft i even wear this when i have a migraine i got the green because it was the only one like it in my size i wanted the burgundy but they were out of the size i need i didn t like some of the other robes so i got this one nice robe but i don t like it so i m returning it love this robe super soft and cozy the fabric is warm but not bulky it s still somehow light weight can t stress enough how soft it is i have a similar style robe from a higher end company spent over 100 on it and this is way nicer my friend is having chemotherapy in a week and i wanted her to have something to comfort her she absolutely loves the robe she couldn t wait to tell me how much she loves it thank you for having such a great robe this robe is super soft and comfortable a little short even shorter than last years secret treasures robe that i purchased i got the color wine fusion heart and it looked so great in person i washed this by it self and unfortunately the purple wine color bled into all of the white area and they are now pink hued it definitely looked better before it dyed itself overall i like these robes but they really need to stop shortening them and it was very disappointing when the color bled and stained the white parts i will forever be washing this by itself i guess the medium was basically the same size as the small so i just kept the small i m 5 5 and a size 2 to 4 in dresses i like my lounge wear to be loose and roomy without falling off or down really either size could have worked for me living in fl i don t need to have this robe all year long but for our winters especially for christmas morning i wanted a comfy fluffy robe this robe has like a ribbed faux velvet texture on a thin base purchased the burgundy one it had a weird smell and some shedding once i took it out of the bag since i ordered online i put some febreeze on it and dried on no heat to take care of the smell i ordered a size up and i am swimming in it but i like that i rather have it fold over me than have it have a gap in front overall i am pleased with it but i def will not buy more colors or give it to anyone it was a one off for me,women's clothing,1

former wearer of victorias secret panties i absolutely love these panties the fit is perfect the colors are great and the lace at the top is very pretty and comfortable i will be purchasing these from now on blissful benefits by warner s made the perfect feature for underwear which is a wide waistband that won t pinch roll down or dig in that helps prevent the dreaded muffin top that every woman hate the lightweight silky microfiber lies flat for a smooth finish and provide a full seat coverage they sit moderately low on the waist they are true to size also they have no tag but on the inside they are label into the panty this review was collected as part of a promotion the size chart on walmart com has very inaccurate information if you follow what size they suggest based on weight hip size etc you ll have underwear that are 2 sizes too small when my order arrived and i looked at the sizing on the package i knew there was no way the underwear would fit so i didn t even try but with the current situation with the pandemic due to family sickness i like these hipster panties because they are true to size and comfortable i really like the microfiber material and the top lace band they come in cute colors and designs and are both functional and comfortable they do not ride up while i m moving during the day this review was collected as part of a promotion upon wearing these panties the first thing i noticed was how comfortable they are the fabric is soft and they are true to size i did not notice any slipping these panties make for a smoother appearance i did not notice any panty lines i would definitely use this brand again in the future this review was collected as part of a promotion i got these underwear a couple of weeks back and not only do they feel good and fit great but they live up to their word of not causing a muffin top they are also breathable and don t cause chaffing or overheating i personally love the hipster style because it gives great coverage while still remaining feminine i liked them so much that i ended up getting 3 different sets of 3 packs this review was collected as part of a promotion these fit great for buying online and not seeing in the store the waistband is perfect to hold the tummy in provides great comfort with no wedges with these either the material is soft and light and they are pretty rides down on the fupa a bit regardless what it says but muffin top or no they re comfortable and when you pull them up they do fine very comfortable no riding up the butt maybe i have the wrong body type my tummy doesn t need help the elastic around the legs accentuate my buns not great i wear pants size 4 and ordered a small everything fit but around my butt it squeezes my cheeks so there is that pinch if i wore tight pants with these like workout pants or jeggings it wouldn t look right because my buttcheek is pinched out the only pair of undies that fit me perfectly shipping was late causing me issues as i was in the hospital and couldn t go to the store myself requiring them to be brought to me love everything about these undies well of course i wouldnt mind if they were a not cheaper they just are always sold out which is a bummer no pun intended this is the 3rd set i have bought so comfortable i love them i have bought in the store before but this time i ordered online because i couldn t find them,women's clothing,1

you have 2 breast not 3or 4 excellent bra lifts and separates handwash please because the colors are just beautiful loved them so much i bought them for both my sisters they agreed and we ordered more colors we range in size from 34 to 44 and each of us were pleased this bra is a winner excellent bra lifts and separates handwash please because the colors are just beautiful loved them so much i bought them for both my sisters they agreed and we ordered more colors we range in size from 34 to 44 and each of us were pleased this bra is a winner fit my splayed wide set breasts perfectly i measure a 34 under bust but the 34 was too tight once i went up to a 36 it was great if you have sensitive skin like me the material may be a little itchy but the bra fits great and i usually have no luck with that so i am very pleased i really love the bras i ve had the same before and they were great they are so pretty and the colors are vibrant comfortable however the band sizing is not consistent be prepared to return some and keep some i ordered 5 of this bra in different colors 2 fit well 2 are a tiny bit tight on the band and cups not a whole size difference but don t fit quite the same as the 2 that fit well i guess i will keep them since these will most likely stretch a bit one is 2 band sizes off when comparing length of the bras it is 2 5 inches shorter see photo it s a 32dd labeled as a 36dd basically definitely retuning that one i m going to order it again and see if i have better luck maybe a couple more colors too,women's clothing,0
385,"Hanes Women's Cushioned Crew Socks, 10 Pack",7.69,4.1,597.0,happy with these socks great fit fit just right ma mom were great and now not really small sizing these are horrible socks socks are defective socks shirts didn t fit the same either very tight fit but these do not buy online if you want cotton socks great socks didn t knock my sucks off cheapest quality ever wrong sizing on package really nice they don t stay up not what they used to be buttery smooth,i was concerned that these socks would cut into my calves like previous hanes cushioned crews i have bought years ago but these are fine i wear size 9 shoes and my calves are what i would consider normal size the size 8 12 fit fine and are very comfortable no indent in my legs at the top of the socks i did mistakenly get a pair mixed in my wash with my flannel sheets and they attracted and unsightly amount of lint but other washings have been fine note that these were also labeled cool comfort which did not affect the thickness of the socks from other hanes cushioned crews i have bought i get these socks in size 5 9 they fit perfectly and the elastic doesn t cut into my calf they wash and wear well and are mostly cotton which is good for your feet i was skeptical about getting these because of some of the reviews some people had different experiences but because of the price i decided to give them a try i already have hanes socks but needed more i love the ones i have when i first received the new ones i tried them on they fit good then decided to wash them to see if they would shrink these are great socks i have worn these for years the material is not as thick as it had been in prior years but i always felt the fabric was too thick before these socks are plenty thick and soft for me i ordered one package and love them very cottony and soft so i ordered another one and the next package came and was totally different as in it is not very cottony at all it is mostly polyester or acrylic i don t like them at all i wish it was stated that the socks had changed very very small sizing i wear an eight but 5 9 size barely fits my heel not really comfortable feel the 9 12 would be just too big i would return but with this national medical situation thought walmart just had more important things to take care of than socks just a little disappointed i was desperate for socks as there were none in the store i wear a size 8 5 ladies but find most 5 9 sized socks are too small tight so went with these 8 12 sized ones thinking i d have room they are polyester and very very tight on the calf and very thin feeling in the material and just barely fit my foot i cannot imagine someone with a size 11 12 foot being able to wear these if i couldn t ni tried one on and immediately knew they would not work very disappointed now i have to deal with returning them and i still have no socks i had these socks 5 months and they must have been a defect all the socks got a hole in the ball of the feet in a perfect circle they were a waste of my money i sent in my review a week ago it wasn t good i had 9 good pair out of 20 pulls strings and actual hole in one not a good review i didn t think you cared not happy expected soft comfy socks and got stretchy elasticky feeling socks these socks are way too tight around the ankles i will be giving them away with only 1 pair used very disappointed other products from hanes have been very good have purchased these several times very good value for the money they wash well they wear well they feel good convenient that they come in a 10 pack i will be back again probably at the beginning of the school year ordered cotton blend socks received socks cool comfort 97 polyester socks if i had shopped in store i would have been able to read the package needed black socks to wear casually and these fit my needs perfectly they are soft cushioned on the bottom and i can interchange them if one gets eattin by the washer they are ok i guess but tend to slip off easy and bunch up in my shoes also i need to call hanes because the pack i received has socks of two different sizes in it these have always been my go to socks that i ve bought for years but this time i noticed they have lowered the quality the top half of the socks are so thin now and i was disappointed not enough to return them but wish they would quit making everything so cheap and thin i had ordered ladies size 5 9 i wear a size 7 5 shoe pack of 10 after receiving and opening the package the socks inside were so small the heel only reached my arch as if they were a child s size plus they are made so cheaply don t want or need these they will be returned so unhappy with the quality of some of walmarts products lately but they seems to do what every sock does and leave that tight ring around your leg so i just fold them down a bit which makes the great true to color and style recommend them just fold them down if you don t like the deep ring they leave or slouch them which gives it an even better look this particular style of hanes were not what i wanted they don t stay up after sleeping with them on in the morning they are basically fall off my feet did a little searching online found that what i had bought in the past was hanes soft comfort socks i returned these bought the other from a competitor that sold them i won t make the same mistake twice cheap quality 10 pairs for 9 is a great price but not for the hassle during the winter months i have always purchased the hanes black crew socks with the colored toe they have always been so thick and comfy my favorite by far but was not able to find them anywhere this year so i went with these instead ni was so disappointed when all through the day a had to pull them up around my ankle because the elastic wouldn t stay up right out of the pack first day i wore them these are so much thinner nothing like the socks i have bought every couple of years or so since 08 or 09 nvery disappointed that i have to find another brand that i like now great socks for the price i like that the band has enough stretch to it but yet stay up on your legs when you first put them on they feel like buttery smooth they are not too thick nor too thin they re going to be my everyday walking socks,women's clothing,0
386,"Fruit of the Loom Women's T-Shirt Bra, 2-Pack, Style FT797PK",36.13,4.0,293.0,love it perfect for the big curvy ladies very nice bra and a great value works great for bigger chests pretty good it s ok band size runs a little small not the best not the worst broken hooks hole what did you expect great fitting bra with good size options great value great not that soft and was damaged upon delivery really nice bra s for the price would buy again save your money great bra,if you cant afford an expensive bra trust me this is worth it you cant expect a 14 dollar 2pk bra set to be the same quality as one compared to 50 dollars for one overall its very durable love these bras i m a dd and the problem i had with my other bras were the side parts being so thick it would go up to my armpits and was so uncomfortable these ones don t do that and are very comfortable i ll be ordering more soon it s been a long time since the last time i bought a new bra with under wire prior to buying these but let me tell you they are a perfect fit i wear a 42d and the couple that i bought are so comfy i sleep in them often before i had these my old bras were terrible and i would never see myself sleeping in a bra til now the best bra i ve bought in a very long time perfect fit and very comfortable i have the hardest time finding bras that are comfortable especially underwire bras they usually dig into my skin and pinch but these bras don t do that i can even sleep in them and i m not at all uncomfortable doing that i have support and comfort now and a really nice fit and i like the style too it doesn t make me look like an ole granny hahaha wow am i shocked i own some pretty expensive bras and somehow these cheap bras are by far my favorite they are comfy but they are very supportive i m a 34ddd so finding a good bra is a task and these are my new favorites they keep everything in and supported these bras are a good quality and value my only complaint is that the fit is not perfect the band was very tight so not true to size but became more comfortable after a few wears it s ok fit a little awkward idk maybe my girls has changed lol otherwise it s ok soft material don t like the underwire but i hv a remedy for tht i hate bra shopping and took a shot in the dark because this was such an unbelievable deal it hasnt been long enough to know how they ll hold up but they seem to be well made and a solid choice for an every day bra the band size seems to run a little small but they did not have the next size up for me to exchange so i am hoping they will stretch a little pretty quickly these bras are soft comfortable and supportive they definitely hold you up however the band size is very small i m a 34 on the tightest hook and can wear a lot of 32s i got a 34ddd and i can only wear it on the loosest hook and it s tight also i am small shouldered and the cups rub under my arms i wear them around the house and for quick errands but wouldn t wear them out all day as they are start to bother me under my arms also a lot of movement in them and i have spillage after the first wash the outer cotton on the bust shrunk anf deformed the cup for the price it s an ok around the house bra after 1 wash both hooks are broken and there is a hole right next to them on the band not true to size but as good as you would expect for the price like most people have said the band size is undersized by one size but bras do stretch as they wear so this won t be the problem with this bra because i have plenty of band to go the cups are not sized right a little bigger than advertised but close enough that i fill 98 of it and nothing is going to wrinkle i probably will keep it for the price all of me is contained and everything is in the right place and the gore sits flat on my chest i have plenty of shoulder strap and i think i can get used to the band because i still am in good shape so i have enough muscle and the band doesn t cut in anymore than a little n nmain conclusion is that they re not perfect but you can t really expect much at this price for two bras so i think you have to be reasonable in your expectations and don t critique it like a 60 bra because it isn t 60 it s not even half if they fixed these two issues i don t know about the deforming from washing them because i just have them now i will buy another pack or two n nof course it would be great to pick your color combination perfect fit i am so glad they offered a 38b which is a hard size to find i prefer my bras to be nude colored because then they can go with everything the fabric on these bras is a knit type fabric so they do cling a little bit to your clothes perfect fit not to much padding in cup underwire is comfortable feels good on back and under arm i always purchase these bra s great value and long lasting very comfortable good look nice fit came out of the washer fine and just air dried i don t put my bras in the dryer as it dries out the elastic faster great price i ordered the same size bra i always wear and with these bras i have to use the last set of loops and it is still a bit snug the bras themselves are good bras however if i were to order it again i would go up one size in the width these are definitely not soft like a tee bra they are more like cardboard there was a hole in one when i received so i returned because of the price i was skeptical but what nice bra s soft perfect size 38a hard to find fruit of the loom also the reason i purchased i like the way it held my girls not to tight and no boulding cup rolls when washed ugh wore bra inside out to accommodate for unsightly lines i ve had several of these bras thinking it was a fluke nope all cups distort after washing i love this bra fits and covers well only thing i dislike is that you can see straps under tanks but that s minor compared to the comfort,women's clothing,0

389,"Fruit of the Loom Women's Cotton Stretch Bikini Panty, 6 Pack",10.98,4.5,307.0,no lines most comfortable for everyday wear awesome for the price polyester free love the colors excellent bikini cotton stretch panties serves its purpose but not perfect don t use their chart for size slow shipping and package destroyed ok product poor presentation bikinis that fit comfy and priced right the colors are wrong unpacked underwear good for the price cute affordable undies nice quality and softness feels just right love love them perfect,i m 195 lbs and i bought the size 8 i love them they dont ride up they dont show a line on my maxi dresses they wash well and dont shrink or pile i also like the different prints these are the kind i like for everyday wear they are 95 cotton and 5 spandex the legs have the stretchy spandex which makes it comfortable ive gotten ones that are 100 cotton and the leg holes are very uncomfortable and tight its definitely a difference if you have the larger thigh area i recommend these these bikini panties are so comfortable they don t bunch up and stay in place i wear size 0 2 pants size but bought the 5 small because i wanted to throw them in the dryer 5 small 4 6 pants size shrunk to my size and now fit me perfectly i would highly suggest size up if you want to dry them in the dryer other than that i highly recommend them perfect fit zero polyester just the way i like it we want wait we purchase not a mixed product if it say cotton it should be cotton and you shouldn t be forced to buy a mix box just to get what we need thank you this product was perfect for me these bikini panties are the most comfortable undies i have ever owned if you have a tummy and get pinched by the underbelly waistlines of bikini underwear and they are tag free these panties are a marvel in that you cannot even feel the line around your gut the elastic is so stretchy and overlaid with very soft cotton rich 100 cotton fabric they are not skimpy about the size i wear a 8 but these have a roomy fit even after washing the different panty colors are also really pretty l like bright undies i am now 100 devoted to fruit of the loom i love these these are my favorite this review was collected as part of a promotion these are great bikini panties i really like that they are cotton and stretch they are not super tight and they have just the right amount of stretch as well like the colors and designs fruit of the loom is a good brand and i recommend them highly also walmart s price for them is good the colors that were sent to me were not my choice but simply a random assortment i prefer the old microfiber material which seems not to be available in the style i wear but this is an adequate substitute however it is quite liable to hold on to stains from unexpected spotting etc and i would not have chosen white or patterns with white liners if i had been given a say the fit is comfortable for me i went by the size information for this product and ended up with them being too small go a size up if you want some thing that fits due to covid19 risk i am stuck with these that are too small underwear isn t the best for what i paid either they are not made well and have loose threads through out i will get a different brand next time i love the underwear however it took a month to receive this order and the package came destroyed shredded package looks used will return this are bikinis and i normally wear the mid rise however these are a good fit they don t cut into your legs ride up pinch your waist and best off all no fade or shrinkage after washing the panties are great simple cut and easy however the colors are not as they were shown on the website they are all different colors of blue oh with the exception of one white pair the panties were good but they were delivered unpacked and then the delivery guy took a photo to show that they were delivered i do not need everyone to see my panties not the best underwear i ve tried but they are great for the price they fit me well and are comfortable the only downside is the band isn t stretchy at all which i something i like cute comfy and affordable just what i was looking for i wear a size 6 8 jeans and got these in size 7 and they fit perfect i really like these undies very soft and good coverage no wedgies during the day pretty colors too great deal for the price first time wearing them this week super impressed i don t know about the wash part yet but i m very pleased wondering why i waited so long to purchase new underwear i didn t realize how soft and stretchy these panties are just by reading the description they feel so comfortable and were reasonably priced i wear a size 10 12 in pants and the size 7 fits great would definitely order again i am really happy with this purchase these underwear are comfortable and breathable they are great for hot summer days or even when working out i will only use these from now on most comfortable underwear i ever had really worth the money doesn t shrink in dryer doesn t rip easily i needed a size 7 for my 160 lbs fits perfectly,women's clothing,1

the best comfy dress ever so perfect a must have in every color perfect for fall poor poor poor great quality for the price perfect teacher outfit nice good but great dress sleeve dress cute casual dress great quality dress,very cute and comfortable dress the color is exactly as pictured looking forward to wearing it a lot in the fall it is the perfect fall color i m 5 4 and it lands right around my knee such a comfortable dress can easily throw on for casual look or dress up a little the fit is flattering and not clingy to every lump and bump i will recommend to all this dress is super soft and a great fit i love how its fitted on top and flowy on the bottom the fabric is beautiful priced right very comfortable dress i purchased every color and two bkack this is a dress you could wear year round in georgia i love it thanks walmart for the great quality and stylish clothing wanted an inexpensive comfortable all purpose dress to wear with a sweater or jacket this was it ordered 4 colors and i m pleased with each one i especially like the 3 4 sleeve length ni m 5ft tall and 135 lbs and the med fits well the length is perfect for me just below the knee would look good with tights or boots washed once and needed just a light press to look perfect i adore this little dress i am not a thin woman and coupled with a little shapewear i feel fantastic in it i love that it can be dressed up or down my go to shoes for this are my tennies and really any of them work it is the most comfortable dress i ve washed it a few times and it still looks good no fading no pilling so far i love everything about these dresses they can be worn alone at this time of year i wear them with leggings from walmart it always looks polished and very fashionable i get tons of compliments then i tell them i bought it at walmart they are the best i wil share with you that i size up so it s loose fitting you will look like you just stepped out of the fashion magazine pair them with low boots i bought many colors and doubled up on the gray and black colors i was shocked by the quality of this cute dress i got it in wine in a medium and its very true to size the cut flares towards the bottom without looking like a tent nice and fitted on top and it has pockets did i miss that in the description i dont know but it s glorious nice touches like a velvet ribbon over the inner neck seam and it washes like a dream i m so glad i bought this flattering dress in two colors and i hope they last for years very nice material 5 foot 3 and weight 140 and a medium fits perfect i love the pockets i absolutely love this dress so much i have purchased every color i can only wear dresses due to medical reasons and have found the perfect one you will fall in love with it his dress just as much as i did i purchased 3 of these olive blue and black to wear with leggings i got a couple compliments on the olive color when i paired it with some o n camo leggings the material is super soft very comfortable and the length is perfect for the look i was going for the pockets are a big bonus however my two issues are with the fabric it is sort of thin and requires extensive ironing after washing subsequently i m not sure i d ever wear this as a dress without leggings underneath because of the thinness not the length i am 45 years old 5 5 140lbs and a little more conservative if you don t mind doing a little extra ironing go for it perfect fit love the color im about 5 feet 8 and 185 lbs and the xl fit very well order now this dress had long sleeves that gang over my fingers im only 5 feet tall and the dress is way too short im also at least a large size and this large was way too big on top of everything else there is a hole in the pocket this is the third time ive tried to order this dress i really want it but im not sure id order another thing from wallyworld walmart then ive had to pay shipping on top of shipping i bought this dress in every color that was in stock the material is a bit heavy but i think that is because it is good quality love the shape of it for my body type my one criticism is the because it has pockets the dress sticks out a little more in those areas and makes your hips look a little wider i bought this dress is 3 colors patterns to wear for my teaching job they are so soft and comfortable and i love that it has pockets i probably could have bought a large rather than xl but i m always worried about the arms being too tight i did hem all three dresses about 3 inches because they fell well below my knees and it s not a flattering length at 5 2 i pair them with pointy flats and a cardigan and it is the perfect teacher outfit i really like the look and feel of this garment i recently had a leg injury and had to find items i could get on and off easily this is something yo can wear around the house or with a little effort dress it up and wear out for the day the material is like a soft t shirt nlittle heavy for summer but definitely nice for autumn weather especially with leggings the neck really bags badly love the feel nice style for all kinds of looks but neck shows its quality not good great little dress the material is soft and doesn t cling it can be dressed up or dressed down bonus it has pockets liked the material a little heavy on a hanger but its nice and breezy material i love this dress i ordered every color the fabric is very soft i ordered a size down so it was more figure flattering the sleeves are tight on the arms i cannot wait to wear the dress this fall i ordered a medium and it fit a little bit loose but i prefer that since i don t want it to be super tight i can easily dress tis up with a belt and heels i am 5 4 at 115,women's clothing,1
391,Hanes Womens Jersey Short with Pockets and Drawstring Waist,6.96,4.4,1774.0,comfy every day shorts five star fot these shorts hot summer comfort shorts are awesome great shorts nice shorts just what i wanted low waist but comfortable complaint not happy nice for the price great summer shorts poor quality love these comfy shorts not soft cotton starchy stiff to the touch great value great length shorts great shorts not what i had hoped they d be mom jean s go bermuda shorts,these are very nice shorts i am 5 2 and they are a good length i like the wide waist band and the fact that they are more of a mid rise makes for a more comfortable and flatttering fit if you are in between sizes i would suggest going with the higher size because while the waist is roomy the legs are not so the drawstring is helpful if you go with the larger size nthe fabric is light but not thin and the pockets while a littls shallow still are plenty roomy so for the price these are quite a good buy and i wish i had discovered them when more colors were available in my size love the shorts i bought them to wear around the home i bought for my daughter for casual wear she loves the fit feel and comfort of the shorts living in the south shorts are a necessity love the comfort as well as the length of the shorts because they re a decent modest length i also love having the pockets because of my disabilities i have medical necessity that i can put in them that i have to have on me 24 7 i truly love the comfort of the shorts just to wear around the house to run to the store as well as to sleep in i have them in four different colors great cotton shorts i use these for lounge wear pjs and working out they fit great good length super comfy and i love that they have pockets quality style and fit are exactly what i expected from hanes excellent shorts always comfortable well made and stylish i have ordered similar shorts from hanes and found all of them to be just what i was seeking comfortable to wear i d give it more stars but the waist sits too low pulling into the crotch they aren t a tight fit on me but with the low waist i wouldn t wear them in public fine for around the house when making the larger sizes the waist needs to be raised to accommodate a more varied curvy body otherwise i d be giving them 5 stars 1 waistband too thick too wide and too bulky makes a woman look thicker in the middle which is the opposite of the thinner look women seek n n2 what is being sold as 100 hanes cotton now the quality has diminished since many years ago now the so called cotton is much rougher texture not soft smooth and cozy as it was many years ago it doesn t feel comfortable at all and the pockets are small and it s really tight nice for the price leave a little room for shrinkage i m 5 ft 7in around 143 lbs large was a bit roomy but perfect after washing and air drying bought a few different colors these hanes women s cotton shorts are just what i was looking for i am 5 feet 8 inches tall weigh 137 and the size small fit perfectly they are soft comfortable and the length is just as stated in the description the fit and colors are good however the quality of the fabric is poor i bought two of these shorts and i tried one on when i tighten the drawstring a piece of the fabric came out can t beat a nice basic pair of cotton shorts with pockets and an elastic waist these were a great length for me i don t like short shorts but i also don t like super long bermuda shorts either because i have short legs these were the perfect in between shorts wish these came in lots of colors i would buy them all these shorts are full cotton but they do not feel like most other cotton items they have what i would describe as a very starchy stiff feel when you touch them wearing them you don t really feel notice it but i still do not like the way they feel to the touch of a hand arm etc i also ordered them in an xl which usually is the perfect size but they re not as loose as i would like would have preferred a size up probably if it would have been simple to return them i think i would have but i didn t want to bother with it if ever i need more black shorts i will shop elsewhere unless hanes makes the smart decision to use softer cotton fabric i don t absolutely hate them but don t love them either so i guess i ll give them three stars liked the length not everyone likes to bare so much leg can be used for lounging or sports only flaw was it arrived with an inch long part of the seam on one of the pockets having come undone but for the price forgivable and nothing a little repair won t fix my hip size was in between m love these shorts i bought them in all the colors they had they have a nice weight to the fabric not too thick for hot days but not paper thin either and are the perfect length i walk to and from work 1 5 miles each way and these don t ride up on me like other shorts do the pockets come in handy also n nl these shorts are well made and very comfortable they are a heavy cotton jersey thicker than a t shirt but not thick like sweats and they have a smooth wide waistband with the elastic fully encased not touching the skin and the pockets are big enough to be useful i was very disappointed that both pairs of shorts shrunk the material feels scratchy and there is very little stretch to the fabric if you wanna look like a dork buy these their at the dork line that isnt flattering rise up when you walk and end up in the pajama pile you re welcome,women's clothing,0

great in between pants not leggings not jeans cute and comfortable jeggings i love these pants cute but stinky smelly don t trust the size pretty great nobo jeggings xlarge amazing tight in the calves best jean pants amazing they re ok never a favorite,the greatest pants in the world appropriately priced and intended strictly for comfy wear i love them and bought 10 pairs i ironed patches on them to jazz them up a little and love the elastic comfort band teenagers probably wont like these little old ladies like me think they are great i love these jeggings i had a hard time tracking some down always none available but was lucky enough to find some the large is too large and the medium tighter then i like i wish they had a medium and a half they would be perfect they are very comfortable and look great i had to buy large then shrink them in the dryer they are still a little to big but i love them anyways best pants for everyday wear soft comfortable and affordable appropriately priced jeans that are intended to be worn as comfy clothes theres no dressing them up or down it was fun to put some patches on the pockets though took some of the plainness out i bought 10 pairs and think they are the best thing in the store go walmart okay so i have now bought these in 3 different colors the light jeans dark jeans and black wash they are perfect stretchy cozy and looks like jeans i m an xl and fits perfect looks cute with boots i wear them to bed and pop awake to take the kids to the bus stop laziness at it s finest i was surprised that i like these as they are a juniors pant but with the stretchy waistband they don t give me a muffin top lol the jeans fabric is sturdy smooth comfortable and very stretchy like a legging should be but they give more support like jeans without the added weight and bulkiness of jeans what can i say that s what jeggings are supposed to do i am 5 4 and weigh 170 i bought l and xl they both fit but the l did shrink a bit so they are really snug kinda have to wear around the house a couple hours to stretch out after washing my tween does not like blue jeans but has grown to the sizes where is difficult to find the preferred pants that are not jeans these are a perfect compromise they aren t too expensive either and i have already inherited a previous smaller size of this very style now outgrown by my child and i like them too for casual wear i like they have back pockets too at that price point i thought they were a great deal the knit waistband is super comfortable the legs fit snug but have lots of stretch knees didnt stretch out over the day and had a nice trim lift at the ankle to wear cuffed or straight bought a second pair already i love these pants wish they came in more colors they are professional enough to wear to work with a sweater they look great with boot or deck shoes super stretchy so definitely will be dressing up my green or orange pair for my thanksgiving feast large pockets they fit great i bought a medium and usually wear a small im at the point in my life where i want to be comfortable as well as not look like i have given up on life lol these are great because unless you lift your shirt up you wouldntdnt be able to tell that there is a waist band these are very cute for all ages def tight in the calves and some may not be able to tolerate or even fit i am 5 5 and 118 lbs and got a med there is a really strong smell to them ive ordered several pair and all smell so i have to wash with baking soda immediately these fit very nice they are soft and will be perfect for cold nights i live in florida so don t wear jeans all that often they are very comfortable these were comfortable but for me tight in that ankles never having low rise pants was not sure what that meant it meant that the pants did not come up high in the back so always had to hike them up after getting up from a sitting position major issue was the smell they smelled musty returned them when i purchased these leggings they were to be on sale i accidently paid full price not worth the money the sizes run very small when i got home with a size 2x more than what i normally wear they were very small and to tight for my comfort i will be returning this item and never buy time and tru again i love that these pants have pockets in the front and not just short they re long too it s every girls dream to have actual pockets to fit things in these pockets are long enough to fit my xr iphone in and i was beyond stoked that i bought another pair minus one star for the bottom of the legs being a little tight maybe i have fatter calves but i do wish the jeggings had a bit more strech in the legs i love these jeggings i love jeans but for the most part they are tight bulky and uncomfortable so these were the perfect solution they are lightweight and look like jeans they help hide my 57 year old pouch without being so tight on my stomach i am 5ft 2in and weigh 140 the large feel tight so the xlarge are perfect as i like my jeans more loose fitting love these they are my everyday jeans these leggings are amazing they do run a smudge small i m usually a medium but got a large and they fit perfectly i m 5 2 and even the length was perfect which is difficult to find with leggings the elastic waist band can get flipped but nothing to the point of not buying them i will be ordering these in every color i like everything about these except that they are a little tight in the calf i don t have super large calves but when i m sitting for a while at work i feel like these are squeezing and cutting off circulation a little bit i love these soft comfortable jean pants i bought 10 pairs threw away all my stretchies put patches on my the pants and im good to go ill probably buy more most

time i m out i am 5 6 and the dress fall right to my knees which i appreciate so it goes with leggings but not a must i also love the pockets because i don t have to bring my purse into the grocery store and also can carry my phone around the house i wear these every week and when they are in the laundry i m sad to wear other things the color is gorgeous it is a super dark green w a blue hint like crayola s forest green i am a size 2x and i ordered a 2x several reviewers say this dress is oversized but don t give their details i am 53 below the breasts and a c cup bra the 2x fit perfectly the dress is very stretchy if you like the tight look then order down one more thing i am 5 3 and the hemline falls just below the knee which is what i was hoping for i live in the south and this dress is the perfect fall dress the material is not too heavy nor thin i am over 5 6 and this dress falls about an inch below my knees the dress can be boxy but if you pair it with a belt around your waist it looks amazing the material of this dress is not stretchy but it does run slightly big great dress to dress up or down omg i love these run a tiny bit big i usually order 3x but got 2x and it fit nice and loose ncouldve probably gone with a 1x the colors are beautiful fabric is soft but not flimsy great length im only 5ft2in and expected these to be so long but they hit below knees as i

perfect for fall winter so excited to have pockets the price is amazing for the quality of this product this is the most comfortable versatile and affordable dress i have ever owned i bought it in teal black navy and purple i m going to buy it in any other color they offer i sizes down as the other reviews i red said the dress ran big this dress even studying down is like a tent it s huge it s a lightweight fabric with pockets which are the only pluses for me it has no shape and makes me look frumpy love this dress so much so i got all the colors i needed something for work where i didn t have to think what should i and this dress works perfectly i added a denim jacket and it looks amazing its breathable and lightweight very nice dress especially for the price purchased before reading the reviews and ordered a size up mistake actually should have ordered a size smaller very comfortable and good quality we are going to have a relative move in for a few months no more ratty clothes i thought these dresses would be perfect and they are the sleeves are a great length the dress can be worn with tights or leggings knee length on me the weight is nice and will be cozy for winter the colors are beautiful very nicely made but not exactly what i thought of when i think of a knit dress it feels more like a silky or polyester blend material but still very nice i love this dress it s long enough for a person who is maybe 5 7 it is a bit shorter on me but i am 5 10 i put a pair of leggings under it and i m ready to go it is so comfortable i ordered the 0x and it fit perfectly at 5 8 220 lbs the ox was a perfect fit the sleeves hit at wrist for my long arms the length hit 4 above knees perfect with leggings i ordered the color cider but received color orange which was like pumpkin spice beautiful for fall the colors are rich and defined as an animal print dress the material and texture of the dress is light and it flows i love the style and design it is a dress you can wear all year with or without a jacket love it i have put on a little weight and wanted something other than slacks this dress is just right comfortable good colors to size all you have to do is add accessories and you have a new outfit these dresses are very comfortable and look very nice i received so many compliments when i wore it the fabric is great nice length and the color was spot on love the pockets great dress for the price just some loose strings on the bottom,women's clothing,0

came in more of a variety of colors but please no easter egg shades i like the brand that s why i ordered but i was sent the wrong size and now i have to return it to the store i don t get out anymore and i m disabled so that s a problem for me ni was happy with the product and the delivery these shirts are nice and soft they re just too short they need to be maybe 2 longer ok this one runs more smaller so i would order two sizes up if you can ugh why can t sizes fit like they should i don t remember them running smaller in sizes why do clothing retailers insist on giving fancy names to what is basically athletic gray i chose this because on my computer screen it looked like a blue gray it s not the fabrics great it s cotton after laundering it s very soft but the seams come undone i washed it once and the seam has come undone on the side the waistbands and leg bands on the underwear do the same i like hain s they just don t stay together i bought a bigger size because i wanted them to be big and comfortable xa0 even two sizes larger than i normally need the v neck was especially close and the overall length was quite short xa0luckily the actual size around was what i wanted but if i hadn t bought them for pajamas you would have gotten them back i am very disappointed in your tee shirts i purchased a size larger to allow for shrinking and they shrink so much i was not able to wear then again i had to put them in the trash we a waste of money i do not think i will order from your company again the picture is deceiving the material looks more substantial than it is one wash twisted it out of shape and not even ironing made this tee presentable enough to wear with a pair of jeans it would be ok to wear under a sweater to layer just as long as you can t see it you really do get what you pay for i bought these for sleep shirt and am deeply disappointed the fit is terrible tight in the bust big in the belly the tees shrink in length when washed so they are like crop tops the incredibly short sleeves are the worst part so unflattering and uncomfortable i was hesitant to order this but there was a free shipping offer so i did i read the other reviews prior to ordering and sized up 2 sizes the tee fit perfectly i am a plus size woman and often tops are bulky this one has a nicely eased a line shape to the sides very flattering if the sizes were accurate a quality loss when off shoring production perhaps i would give this tee a 5 super light weight and perfect for a steamy summer please stock more v neck tees and review your suppliers to ensure accurate sizing i ordered 2 of these tee shirts size 2x because that is the size i wear when i tried them on they just fit but i m dieting so figured they d be ok when i lost another 5 10 pounds i washed them in cold water and dried on medium heat they shrunk up to be crop tops i m wearing them to bed now with a pair of pajama pants cannot wear them out in public i d advise everyone to order up at least 1 size if not more i ve ordered from just my size before and this has never happened i bought a 3x in this shirt because people said it ran small in other brands i wear a 2x sometimes 3 i think i would need a 5x in this tshirt i m going to take it to a local outlet to try and exchange it i like the color and the weight is good for summer i ordered this top in a size 5x knowing that they are prone to shrinkage n ni love the softness of the material and the length of the sleeves however the shirts are cut in a wide cut and short in length this was not a problem with me as it fits my silloute however if you have a longer torso this will not be the look for you this top is not rounded at the bottom as depicted however but very straight cut n nall in all i was very happy with my purchase these tees are a bit boxy and not as thick as i thought they would be they do shrink a little and that s washed in cold water and air dried they do hold their shape after initial wash which is good overall i would say hanes need to stick with what works and stop changing everything all the time i was really looking forward to receiving these tshirts but fortunately i am having to return them i have been wearing a size 3xl for a number of years in all kinds of clothing when i received my tshirts i tried them on they were too tight and they were a 3xl i am hoping to continue making purchases with hanes especially now that i m aware that the sizes differ i loved the color and fit of this shirt i wore it washed it in the machine and hung it on the clothes line i put it on and it had six small holes and two runs i understand that it was inexpensive but i thought that by avoiding the dryer i would get more than one use,women's clothing,0
404,"Fruit of the Loom Women's Long Underwear Waffle Crew Neck Thermal Top, 2-Pack",14.99,4.0,88.0,the shirt to wear birthing goats on cold nights fruit of the loom thermal shirt order up lovely thermal tops perfect for layering to play to work to sleep comfy top great added warmth a bit short in length warm but uncomfortable very small arms are not comfy nice top tight fitting thermal shirt nice lightweight comfy set of two waffle weave thermal tops weird fit in arms soft to the touch warm and comfy sizing is off size was off but nice light material sizing is off,i love these shirts i live on a 10 acre farm we breed goats births always seem to happen on the coldest nights i put on as many layers of clothes as i can which is a lot i can have on 4 shirts 2 3 pairs of sweat pants gloves mittens hat scarves and a blanket poncho over all of that these shirts impress me for several reasons they are thin so layering is much easier with them on the bottom layer they add a layer of warmth they aren t traditional white so i don t have to look like i m wearing thermal underwear the underside is smooth not nobby and rough the only con isn t a big deal but may matter for my size they seem to run a little small i wear a size 18 so a 2x should have been ok these didn t feel like a size too big maybe they are they don t shrink in the wash i ll buy more of these they are my go to for thermal shirts now well it s that time of year again where colder weather prevails even here in the state of texas lol the women s fruit of the loom women s thermal waffle crew will help you ward off the cold 80 polyester 20 cotton spandex in the ribbed cuffs will help you stay warm the fabric wicks away sweat to help keep you dry and retain body heat the neck area is tag free no itchy irritating tags i love the design and the feel but if you order it keep in mind it sizes smaller i wear a medium and could barely get my arms in the arms of the shirt and had to keep pulling down the front so upsize a large probably would have fit better i absolutely love these thermals i travel a lot and wear them all the time i like to layer clothes so these are perfect for me i also wear them as pajamas when it s laundry day they re thin enough in warm weather and they keep you warm under clothes in the winter i m a huge fan of the cuffs on the ends of the sleeves it feels like it keeps the warmth in the majority of the shirt has the basic waffle pattern and the cuffs are solid black these are from the plus size collection and i ordered a 8 10 cause i m normally a medium but i measure 36 ddd and it s a bit tight trying to get it over my chest it fits everywhere else so i m happy with the product next time i will order a large to give my chest some more breathing room but overall i m happy with these not to mention you get 2 in a pack that s a good deal i have enjoyed the two thermal tops i selected for review the material is not too thick and these are really nice tops for layering during colder weather i selected the navy blue top and the black top they are easy to coordinate with my wardrobe all the seams are nicely sewn and they did not shrink after i washed them i look forward to wearing these tops for years to come i received these products free of charge for reviewing and writing my honest opinion i am a member of the walmart spark reviewer program fruit of the loom women s waffle textured thermal long sleeve shirt is perfect for layering under tops sweaters or by itself with a scarf color is a true deep black medium size measures back neck to waist 24 1 2 front neck to waist 22 sleeve from armpit to wrist 16 1 2 cuffs are ribbed on the wrist see pic but still easy to fold up to create a 3 4 sleeve cuff does not have a thumb hole launders does not shrink or fade in the wash love that it does not come out if the dryer all wrinkly feels super soft and breathable absorbs moisture while wearing love that fruit of the loom uses 6 recycled water bottles to make each shirt this shirt is perfect for sleeping to day wear to play wear i am a walmart spark reviewer and i had the pleasure of reviewing the fruit of the loom women s waffle thermal lounge crew top this top is so warm and comfortable the fit is great the feel of the waffle pattern is actually smooth it is not bulky this top is of good quality it s colder and thermals shirts are just the thing to wear under sweaters and sweat shirts i usually wear darker clothing during the winter so having a dark shirt to wear underneath was a blessing to have this shirt is completely black without a grayish tint to it the sleeves fit me just right and the size was fitting but a bit short as it barely covered my stomach i prefer longer thermal shirts i can tuck into my pants but this one wasn t long enough i am tall so this may not apply to everyone however i can wear it comfortably underneath a sweater the shirt does ride up at times which can be annoying but provides the extra layer of warmth when it is needed the shirt is tagless with prevents any itching but the writing on the shirt has already started to fade after a single wash doesn t bother me much but i am sure this can be a nuisance to others the pack i received was a three back of black in size 3x which is a hard size to find i would recommend this item no it s not as long in length as i would prefer but it is comfortable when wearing under other shirts perhaps measure the length you prefer and decide on this product before purchasing there were things i liked and disliked about this thermal under shirt it is a very thin light weight material the thinness and lighter weight of this thermal under shirt make it perfect for layering underneath sweat shirts or t shirts it is surprising warm considering how thin it is it has a waffle knit weave and is not itchy against your skin like some of the other under shirts i have tried before it is black and matches just about anything you wear it with if visible i typically wear a size small to a medium in shirts and have a size medium in this particular shirt it has a great fit in every way except the arms this was the only real drawback of this thermal under shirt for me but it is a deal breaker i do not have unusually large forearms for a woman but it was so incredibly tight on my forearm area i could not stand wearing this shirt it is a real shame since i loved most every thing else about this thermal under shirt i can not wear a shirt that i can not shove the sleeves up in order to wash my hands these shirts are a thin thermal shirt and are very small i got a medium i normally wear a 10 and it was way too small for me i could barely get it over my head order a size up when i think fruit of the loom i think stretchy cotton comfort not this thing i wear a size small to medium top this is a medium 8 10 and is so uncomfortable that i could not wait to get it off it was such a tight and non stretchable material that it actually cut off my circulation when i bent my arm i don t know if it s because it is 80 polyester or the making of it but for me it was horrible when it s off and you pull on the material it seems to have a little give but i cannot wear it the look and the color is good the fruit of the loom women s and the fit for me women s plus waffle thermal underwear crew top 2 pack is very thin and lightweight but still surprisingly warm and because it is so thin it makes it really easy to use when layering i like that it is 80 polyester and 20 cotton it s really nice that the polyester is recycled and the cotton is traceable the label says to not use fabric softener it is really helpful that they are finally putting that on labels of clothing that are supposed to be really breathable i ve read that fabric softener can really reduce the breath ability be aware that the sizing runs really small my daughter usually wears a medium shirt size but a medium of this top was way too small for her overall i d recommend this to anyone looking for a nice lightweight layer able top fruit of the loom women s waffle thermal lounge crew top is a great base layer shirt it fits snug on the skin especially on the arms so your next layer won t feel like it bunches up the thermal tops are very warm i am 5 1 and 140 lbs and the pictures show the top fits me these thermals are nice and lightweight but still plenty warm the reason for the 4 stars rather than five is the length is a little bit shorter than i d like however i will be wearing a shirt over the top or wearing them to lounge around the house the price point is definitely nice making it a good value for the money received this ladies set of two thermal tops as a member of the spark reviewer program this top is actually a thinner lighter weight version of the waffle weave tops i have had in years past it is thin enough to wear under a sweater or shirt in colder climates and super comfortable for lounging at home with your favorite leggings on i received a size medium but they are cut to fit so you may want to size up i enjoy these tops and love that they came in a set of two they add a nice layer of warmth and comfort i was looking forward to this two packet thermal crew top my adult daughter gets cold at work and wears a uniform the only option for her is to wear a long sleeve solid black shirt under they arrived and the material was a light waffle type i thought it might be see through because its light weight but it didn t show any signs of see through once on unfortunately the arms were very strange they are super tight but its loose on other places her arms are not big at all they are regular to small ish sized she wears a medium consistently normally the problem area for her is the chest section is where she struggles but that was a great generous fit but the arms were so tight she couldn t get them all the way up to her armpit and weren t appearing to stretch she still tried it the shirt absorbed moisture when she was sweating when things heated up she didn t feel the sweat like she did with a different style shirt she tried we are going to wash it and try again to see if the arms loosen up a bit if they don t she will not be able to wear because she said the tightness was distracting especially when she bent her arms fruit of the loom waffle thermal tops are not scratchy on my skin long sleeve and long body the weather is getting colder so these thermal tops are great for layering easy to care for just toss in the wash dry and hang up or fold they are easy to pack and wont take up any room in my luggage or week end get away bag comfy enough to wear as a pj top too long sleeves allows you to wear under a t shirt for layering and take off when it warms up love the versatility of the top and the ease of care fruit of the loom loungewear tops i chose black soot so that i could easily match any outfit for relaxing or working around the house these long sleeve thermal tops are soft and warm the waffle fabric is ideal for the cooler weather they come in a pack of 2 and can be layered to keep me comfy during the day and extra cozy at night these indoor tops can also be worn outdoors i have i just didn t tell anyone eco friendly they are made from a blend of 80 recycled polyester and 20 cotton each from 6 recyclable plastic water bottles great for the environment less waste in our landfills easy maintenance they are simple to care for with straightforward instructions gentle cold water wash no bleach tumble dry on low and they are ready good to go if needed you can press polyester but who irons loungewear i have already put them through a couple of wash cycles so far no problems with fading shrinking or tightening around the cuffs or hems they seem built to last a good wash and wear top for lazy days at home or for busy ones out shopping or running 101 errands i haven t had the best of luck with fruit of the loom clothing in general in the past their pieces always ran small i was excited to try this fit for me brand by fruit of the loom hoping they had worked out some of the kinks with the sizing unfortunately the result was the same these long sleeve crew tops are a nice staple to anyone s wardrobe and value priced they are a waffle type knit but it s not thick so it can easily be layered under shirts or a vest the length of the sleeves was perfect the length of the shirt itself was good and the crew neck was comfortable making it the ideal cold weather wear i could easily imagine sleeping in it if you needed a little extra warmth i usually wear a 22 or 24 in tops depending on the cut of the garment and the material this top in 3x 22 24 should have fit perfectly instead it fits more like an extra large i understand it s supposed to be snug to the body but it shouldn t fit this tight to the point if i lift my arms i m afraid it may rip the sleeves also run small being too tight around the upper arm i would suggest if you re interested in these pieces to buy a size or two larger the size on these were a bit small the arms were tight so i won t be able to wear them i do like that the material is lighter than most other thermal wear so it can be worn under another shirt and i wouldn t be over warm i like fruit of the loom as a brand but i would be afraid that these tops might shrink even with a larger size so i m not sure i would buy these particular crew tops i will probably look at other brands for a bit better quality i do like the no label imprints on the back of the neck it is soft and doesn t scratch i would recommend this to persons who would like a lighter thermal material but if someone wants a heavier feel then they wouldn t enjoy these i haven t had the best of luck with fruit of the loom clothing in general whether it be outerwear or underwear their pieces always ran smaller than they should i was excited to try this fit for me brand by fruit of the loom hoping they had worked out some of the kinks unfortunately the result was the same these long sleeve crew tops are a nice staple to anyone s wardrobe and value priced they are a waffle type knit but it s not thick so it can easily be layered under shirts or a vest the length of the sleeves was perfect the length of the shirt itself was good and the crew neck was comfortable making it the ideal cold weather wear i could easily imagine sleeping in it if you needed a little extra warmth where it fell short was the sizing i usually wear a 22 or 24 in tops depending on the cut of the garment and the material this top in 3x 22 24 should have fit perfectly instead it fits me like an extra large i understand it s supposed to fit snug to the body like long underwear but it s literally skin tight on me to the point if i lift my arms i m afraid it may rip the sleeves also run small and are too tight around the upper arm it s so uncomfortable i couldn t possibly wear it i see it s also available in 4x but i m afraid even a size up would not be enough it s very disappointing when you really like a brand but their sizing is so off,women's clothing,0

410,Skechers Bobs Keepsakes Ice Angel Clog Slipper (Women's),27.95,4.5,332.0,only slippers i will ever buy coming back for more my second pair this is the second time i bought this style wonderful shoes more like shoes than slippers daughter loves them i want another pair these are the best love em love will never go back to nike love sketchers review yes i different colors but later on great everyday slipper,these are actually really comfortable i purchased a pair looking for something cute that i could just slip on and run out the door for the casual things or quick errands they are perfect for that they have great traction and a the back comes up just a little bit on the heel keeping the shoe in place that was a bit of an adjustment for me but i really like it now n nalso they are comfortable enough that after a day of being on my feet i can slip these on and not have my feet hurt while i take care of things around the house n nand they re cute i d definitely purchase again i have been using these slippers for over 10 yrs real suede and they are old and time to replace i ve thrown them in the washer a few times they are very durable best slippers ever upset that my size isn t available i ve had a pair of these for several years now always get compliments on them and they still look like new my daughter decided she wanted a pair too so she selected this based upon the ones i have she loves them they ve replaced her house slippers but she wears them on short hops outdoors as well i bought a pair of these bob s keepsakes ice angel s last winter and they are still like new i bought another pair recently as a back up just in case they stop making them i have planters fasciitis and my home has hard wood floors throughout so finding a good supportive house shoe is a must for me last winter i was looking online for slippers and reading reviews as i have gone through many pair trying to find the right ones that worked for me when i came across these skechers i liked the way they looked and noticed they had many good reviews i ordered a pair based on the positive reviews i read and ones other people had written who also had foot issues when they arrived and i tried them on i immediately fell in love with the fit and softness they have skechers signature memory foam which is a plus and i like the thick sole as it gives more support they are also very warm in the winter months i wear mine year round as house shoes i have read some people wear them as actual shoes i suppose they could be worn as either i usually wear an 8 1 2 in skechers but based on reviews i ordered an 8 at first they were a little snug around the top but they do stretch out with wear i recommend ordering a half size smaller than your usual size and allow them to stretch and conform to your feet i highly recommend these slippers i use these as my cold weather slippers because i can wear them outside when i let the dog out or fill the bird feeders without having to change to boots this is my second pair of this style because my first pair lasted over 10 years thinking about getting another pair because they are so comfortable very comfortable i have to have wide sizes and am really pleased with the fit great fit great price warm great fit great price warm love these shoes warm and comfortable these would be great as a shoe or if you go outside in your slippers the sole of the shoe is designed for this but at a comfort price there s no give as in the white soles that skechers provides on lots of their shoes that sole allows for more give and is not as rigid i would never buy these again as a house slipper they hurt my feet after too much wear so much for comfy sunday s puttering around the house daughter wore out her currant 8 year old sketchers slippers so i got her new ones for christmas she says they fit perfectly very glad to get same ones again i purchased these slippers because i have palmar tacitus and and am my feet most of the day i needed the cushion and support that these slippers help accomplish these are the best i wear these around the house all the time when i am not at work very comfortable and warm would buy them again no complaints at all i buy 2 pairs one for going out as they are very comfortable and easy to get on and off the 2nd pair i wear as slippers because i have concrete floors and severe back pain i have also had 3 spinal fusions this is the second pair i bought i know they are slippers but i had foot surgery and they are all i wear right now they are so comfortable and warm i have an inside and out pair now i bought this because i have severe pain in my feet and hips when i put these on it has the perfect amount of support that at the end of the day when i go to bed my feet don t hurt i will never go back to nike there on my feet every time i get out of my chair out of bed they re very soft and comfortable and also help with back pain and just all around ease the mind i bought these as a

413,Radiant by Vanity Fair Women's Full Coverage Comfort Wirefree Bra,11.8,4.3,427.0,happy with my new sports bras no more bouncing great after heart surgery best bargain bra fantastic bra looking for hard to find size fits well d cups and bigger don t need padding ehh oddly fitting a little tight lacks support just buy it you will not be sorry great bra the straps hurt disappointing one of the most comfortable bras i ve ever had soft pretty but no support just ok,they are so soft and very nice i ve been wearing hanes underwire for many years and although i ve tried wirefree several times and was never happy with them because they would ride up when i reached for something this bra doesn t and keeps me from bouncing and are they re very comfortable to boot my search is over this is a very good choice for quality vs price i order two bras during past year beige and white which look exactly the same as in the picture i am ordering two more today it is soft and provides full support i would recommend it for daily casual wearing my 77 year old mother had quadruple bypass surgery back in fall 2018 all of her older bras and any bras with an underwire would irritate her scar these are the first bras she has found that dont cause any discomfort these have sincerely increased her quality of life this bra is a great bargain it fits well and provides support without underwires i bought it in white and black at the store and i ordered 3 more in honey because i liked the others so much bras are difficult to find and when i find one i like i buy several in all of the colors this is definitely a style i like and it is available at an unbelievably low price soooo very comfortable fit perfect full coverage and wireless is perfect and it really does offer full support now i want another one it is wonderful to find the unusual size 40b the bra itself is well made and very comfortable for every day wear very comfortable but wish it came with an a cup runs a little large in cup area but will still wear stays up on shoulders well this bra is pretty and nicely made it looks like a much more expensive item and is true to size the problem i have is that any woman who wears a d cup or larger does not need a padded bra while described as light lining this actually has a structure that increases your size and feels like padding hey bra makers d dd ddd bra wearers want a lining and not padding very pretty bra but i bulge out with this one i bought another along with this one a fruit of the loom same size and that one fits me sooo much better bra shopping is hard as it is but i say maybe go a size up it doesn t make sense why i bulge with this one and don t with my fruit of the loom one purchased a 38b bra tossed this one into the donation bin with the tags still on its my size but not close to fitting my body also some might note it has foam lining which really isn t very clear if it had fit i might have tried cutting that out those straps in the picture look like they might be softly padded unfortunately they were not i ordered a couple of these in various colors and i found them to be not very comfortable the straps tend to dig into the shoulder a bit there s not much support at all also i found them to run a little to the small size i ordered 38b i ll keep these to wear on brief occasions running to the store etc i would not want to wear these all day i do like vanity fair women s bra s and items but this particular item i was disappointed omg this is by far the most comfortable bra i have ever owned 42d is what i wear usually and a 42d fit perfectly normally at the end of the day i can t wait to rip my bra off but not this one i could probably sleep in it i m purchasing 3 more great bra for the price i love this bra fits perfect will be buying more comfortable and good price will be ordering another one the straps are to thin and when you cross the back they dig in to your shoulders i find this bra very painful this might be a good fit for smaller cups but at a d it doesn t sustain the weight there is a rough material under the cups that scratch and i can t adjust the straps high enough to get the girls where they belong it looks nice on the model but totally uncomfortable for me one of the most comfortable bra s i have ever had i now want them in every color such a great price for something so soft and supportive compared to other brands the color and fabric are great super soft and the back support is really good i was disappointed in the shoulder straps and cups i was left with a uniboob and red shoulders i was hoping that this bra was equal to the full figure underwire that vanity fair makes it is not and does not support dd after wearing bras with underwires for years i decided to try something different this bra is ok not great but not terrible its very comfortable but it doesnt have the lift i would like also the shoulder straps are comfortable if you can keep them from folding over on themselves,women's clothing,0

sports,these bras are absolutely amazing i buy at least two packs every year for the past 5 years nmy height 5ft 8 n my weight 220 lb my bust 44dd nevery year i buy a size 44 nthese are absolutely amazing they re super cute you can always mix and match with whichever outfit you re wearing for the day it has no padding which is fantastic because who needs that these are so comfortable i love the straps they don t slide down and the bra doesn t climb up i feel supported and cozy at the same time perfect for working at home or running errands i sized up from my normal bra size i usually wear a 44 but for these i wear a 46 i love love love this style of sports bra i have all different colors and sizes they are supportive yet the thin spaghetti straps make it so you can wear them under everything these are really great in the summer under tank tops even spaghetti strap tops if you get the same color wearing these 24 7 for many many years yep even sleeping in them they definitely arent sexy but they re cotton they re comfortable and they work wonders to alleviate fibrocystic breast tenderness i love all of the fruit of the loom unlined non underwired bralettes these are no different i do think the straps on these are a bit longer then the thicker soft bra straps but i hand stitched a few threads to make them the correct size for me and they are perfect i ll continue to buy these and variations of them until they stop making them that being said please don t stop making them i love the way these look under muscle shirts with large armholes really cute and very comfortable they run very small i am normally a 34 after reading reviews i bought the 38 and they fit but just a bit snug i ended up buying 40 and it fits perfect my bra size is 36d and the 36 fit me good these are great for running errands and lounging around the house i like how the straps are designed to be hidden under most tshirts nreason i did not give 5 stars is because the straps cant be adjusted these cotton bras are tight fit and not very stretchable i had a set size 32 my regular bra size and they were so tight that i felt i could barely breathe this time i ordered 34 one size up and they fit much better i don t wear them for workout i wear them in the house or under a shirt they are comfortable it doesnt have any padding and doesnt lift or support i know its a sport braw and it shouldnt have to do that but it just doesnt look nice if im not wearing a bra its like a shirt with an extra layer i bought a size medium thinking it would be made of stretchy material when i tried it on it fit very tight i wondered if i had bought a medium in children s i contacted the company by email to see if i could return or exchange the bras and have not heard back from them fits too a t and extremely comfortable i m am a 36b and fits true to size i tried these for my outdoor hiking etc and support if great i will be purchasing more as i need to sleep in a bra for security and these are perfect not complaints here super comfortable and true to size fit however they only come with 1 pair of padding to use between the 3 sports bras i would have given 5 stars if each had their own padding meh no real support but didn t expect any perfect for quarantine holds the girls in when bending over and gardening and super comfy can t ask for more for the price my 14 year old loves these and wears them everyday no matter what activities sports she has going on nshe wears them inside the house or the backyard without a shirt they are a great fit comfy and perfect for the young modest teen i wear these bras every single day they are extremely comfortable and have great coverage i wash them regularly and they are still just like new also its nice to be able to get the 3 pack with multiple colors so you have one for every outfit they x80 x99re not thin or cheaply made like some of the similar brands you x80 x99ll find you can x80 x99t beat the price either i would absolutely recommend to everyone i can only afford to buy these about once a year the 3 pack lasts me that time they are comfy enough to sleep in if you choose sometimes they send me a slightly different design from what i ordered but makes no difference i am so glad to receive it these things are like gold great quality comfortable with the perfect amount of support i bought these for my pre teen because

417,Blissful Benefits by Warner's® Women's Ultrasoft Wire-Free Contour Bra RM1691W,10.46,4.6,538.0,my favorite best bra must buy so comfortable awesome wire free bras very nice bra soft and seemless cups feels great at a great price awesome soft best bra i own blissful benefits by warner s women s ultra soft very comfortable unhappy with warners design the comfort shape and lift is amazing comfortable bra for crossdressers good bra comfort and shape without underwire,i wish they had then in a cup but it s still worth it with b cup i only notice the difference of the cup size when laying down lol it doesn t rise up doesn t completely move if you were to pick something up or lift your arms basically perfect for work i bought b40 40 is hard to find for a and b cup if these were in 38 or 36 i would still get them since i have a hook extender would recommend and rebuy i love this bra it is so soft it is so comfortable it also provides comfy support and has a no show no line contour i have it in multiple colors i hope they never quit making this one i will be purchasing this one for years to come as it is my favorite it also has held up well from multiple washings the best comfortable easy to wear i have bought these before and they have been washed several times they have held up very well so comfortable that you forget you have one on this is absolutely my favorite bra ever i cant even begin to explain how much i love it so so comfy and holds them in im buying 2 in every color this item fits like the softest glove you ve ever worn you might actually forget you have a bra on outstanding product these bras are my favorites they are comfortable supportive and provide concealment while offering definition so many of my under wire free bras leave me looking like i have one large shelf across my chest but these do not the padding is just enough keep everyone from knowing i am cold without adding a lot to my cup size this is my second round of these bras and it won t be my last love this bra i used to only wear playtex bras but they do not carry the one i like anymore this bra is soft and has seemless cups and is true to size i looked for a long time to find a good bra with a good fit that was seemless this is it i wear a 38c and this is true to size i am very pleased with this bra it is soft and comfortable and better than i had expected i hesitated to order a bra because it s hard to get the right fit without seeing it in the store now that i see how well it fits and the good material i wouldn t hesitate to order another one tried this after reading another reviewer saying she feels like she isn t wearing a bra at all i agree this is the most comfortable bra i ve ever tried m not always having to adjust the straps and it doesn t feel too tight or pinchy anywhere full exposure i ve only tried a few of the more expensive and designer brands in the market i don t believe in being overcharged for this basic item we need ni just wish there is a 38a for the less naturally endowed i purchased 3 of these they fit well and are comfortable and to size with that being said sadly 2 out of the 3 i had to return exchange because one of the hook portion of the eye and hook keeps breaking i am trying exchanging them in the hopes that they were a fluke but they were two separate orders so who knows if they can t stand up to basic use for 2 weeks than no matter how well it fits and comfortable it fits it s a waste of money love everything about this bra i bought one in store ordered a second online in another color plan to order a third color true to size very nice product this is my absolute favorite bra and the only one i want to keep buying as comfy as a bra can get doesnt have an underwire but some how still gives you the lift you are looking for highly recommend i love the blissful benefits by warner s women s ultra soft wire free contour bra rm1691w the only problem i have with it is the band rolls up a little to much very nice soft comfortable like adjustable shoulder straps and 3 hooks especially like bottom band wish they came in more colors like black hard to find even on line a d size bra needs more than 3 hooks and a nice wide strap i never bought a warners bra before and never will again its not designed for a full size woman nice bra but it should not be sold in large sizes this bra is very comfortable and smooth you don t see any lines through the thinnest clothes it s wire free great for any occasion workouts sleeping if your a mom that nursed and need that extra lift and comfort i would definitely give it a try the fabric is durable and it hugs your shape and lift which gives you a more youthful look i bought this bra in 44b it fits well and is not noticeable under my tops i am a male who loves wearing women s clothing i have bought several of these bras comfortable enough to wear all day and into the night so comfortable i forget i m wearing a bra i highly recommend this bra to everyone male and female it s a very comfortable brassier however you should measure your bust size before ordering to get the right size i think that if you want your bust to look more lifted and firm probably another bra would be a better fit in general i would order it again i picked up one of these bras while passing through the store for a few other items and ended up loving how the bra fits and feels the bra has full coverage yet doesn t show at the tops of my shirts the bra is also very comfortable i wanted something more than cotton but didn t want any underwire i was concerned that maybe it wouldn t wash well but ive washed it several times and it still feels comfortable without losing any shape i ended up ordering four more a few weeks later because it became my go to bra,women's clothing,0
418,"Fruit of The Loom Women's Cotton Stretch Extreme Comfort Bra, Style 9292PR, 2-Pack",13.94,4.5,1111.0,soft cotton comfortable supportive underwire bra they really nice held it s condition well comfortable fit light as a feather feel free as a bird they really are comfortable bras just perfect best bra ever great why is there lace on this bra pretty good comfortable really like these bras comfort fit and price fit is fine quality was less than in past nice price mediocre bra wonderful bras comfortable and lightweight nice but not for me disappointed with lace trim that was not expecting,love it its cotton thats hard to find these days its soft and comfortable and supports my breasts beautifully these bras a great they are true to size n hold u perfectly i ve had these bras nearly two years now and they have held up very well for me the fit is very comfortable and the cotton makes it especially for for summer or when we are hiking there is no padding at all so if that is what you want you won t like this but i have no problem with that in fact that is what i prefer this style is the most comfortable bra i think i ve ever worn i actually had purchased one from a thrift store and after years it still has maintained its integrity so i was confident to actually purchase new the flat underwire is so comfortable i forgot it had them and continues up the sides for support and there is no poking i really liked that i could choose the colors i need when buying on line in the store i d get stuck with black or gray depending on my color choice of one in the double pack also for some odd reason the on line bras seem to be better made they all fit perfectly i also liked the addition of the lace this is pure comfort in a bra feels just like a cotton t shirt i originally ordered one 2 pack to try on and as soon as it arrived and i tried it on and jumped up and down a bit to see how it behaved i went and purchased 5 more 2 packs i wear vs brand 38dd padded but got tired of wasting 60 on a single bra that i just wanted to try something simple and cheaper in price anyways this definitely delivered it is not padded but it does a great job at lifting cant say for people with bigger breasts than mine though i am sure breast type plays a role mine are rounder for the price just try it hopefully you wont regret it like me i will be purchasing more to stock up soon most comfortable bra you will ever have excellent love having two hooks in back because i don t like all the extra width too hard to hook for me i like both plain and lace boarder so it doesn t matter if they send either or i wear a 38d and they are perfect please don t ever stop making these needed it for my skin allergies cannot go wrong with cotton it does not have padding of any sort so you would not be able to use with thin shirts i use them under sports bras for extra support as i am a 34d and the material in sports bras also give me allergies these are great beware they are putting lace along the edges of the cups on some of these bras i ordered three color combinations online and one set came with lace ew i love these bras because they are cotton and plain and because they fit but i can never find my size in the store 36b among the sea of humongous sizes so i must order online neither walmart nor fruit of the loom show or mention any lace being added to this bra the style number is the same on both styles see the photos for the with and without lace styles i like these bras for their simplicity and comfy fit no padding but just enough coverage the straps are thicker than i thought they would be but it s fine the black bra had some seams that were stiff and very itchy i haven t had that problem with the nude bra all around a decent value and i would consider purchasing these again in the future if they hold up well soft and comfortable i prefer underwire and strongly dislike padding so if you are like me you will love it cotton makes is comfortable to wear in the heat of summer and in the colder climate finally found bras in my size that are not minimizers and have no padding i keep wondering why bra manufacturers don t realize that women in larger than a c cup probably do not want need padding so far i am satisfied with the fit support and comfort level of these bras and the price can t beat it i have worn these bras for years price is right fits well and very comfortable only complaints are you can see nips when wearing thin tops and i can t seem to find them in the stores anymore so comfortable i am just debating if i should order a size up next time the band fits just right on the last clip i like feeling confortable while at home and this does it for me quality of manufacturing was lacking had a hole in one side of one of the bras not worth sending back but not likely to buy online again fit was as expected but be wary and purchase only in store to be able to look over the seams and material not very supportive but fairly comfortable make extra sure to get a slightly smaller size if you want it more fitted i would have ordered smaller the underwire sticks out a bit too far because though the cup is well fitted it s too loose underneath and the underwire stretches out beyond the actual cup which is weird also i really wish you could adjust the straps higher but you can t it deserves 2 stars but i m giving it 3 if you just want some loose off day support i mean i guess you can get that out of a sports bra sleep one but i am trying to be fair it isn t the worst and the price is fair i am so happy with my bras i have always had an issue with the cost of bras compaired to men s undershirts i placed my order for two sets of bras and received them very quickly i am 100 a fan now they were exactly what i wanted non molded cups underwires and they are the best fitting bras ever i got 4 bras for less than half the cost of many of my single bras that don t fit nearly as well as these i have been ordering these bras for some time and first found them in the story i like that they are lightweight and comfortable just a little lace around the top makes them cute they hold up in washing and can put them in the dryer or air dry i liked the material but think it s probably better for smaller breasted women because the underwire on larger size is just too much for me and uncomfortable but you should try for yourself i probably would have liked very much back when i was a c cup although i like the bras they were trimmed with lace i have purchased the same bra in walmart without the lace and it was not shown with the lace in the product info nor was it mentioned in the description very disappointed the black and tan combo were without lace but the white and tan combo had lace unfortunately bought two packs of that color,women's clothing,0

issues and as comfortable as a bra this size can be excellent quality for the money i wear a large size bra so when i order a bra on line i am always taking a chance that it will fit nwhen i received this bra and tried it on it fit perfectly and i have good support my only wish now is that i could get this bra in a variety of colors this bra is super comfortable i really like it the pricing is excellent and it ships quickly being a full figured girl i really like that it only has 4 small hooks in the back and is not a huge band strapped across your back the front plunge is deep enough that you can wear any v neck tee shirt without showing your bra it is a full coverage bra not a demi or push up bra if you re looking for a full coverage reasonably priced underwire comfortable tee shirt bra then look no further this is the one for you holds up the triple d twins nice and comfy i only order this brand over time the underwire may break but still worth it to purchasing multiples for the low price vs paying 50 100 for 1 single bra elsewhere and still not have the comfort it s hard to find a bra that fits well and doesn t give you a cone look this bra is amazing and it s black very good quality for the price it s also very comfortable and gives good coverage i really like secret treasures bras from walmart okay this bra is the best fitting bra i ve found since i last shopped at v s and that was many years ago when they no longer sold my cup size anyway this bra fits amazing its soft it fits me perfectly the only dislike i have is the straps again are a bit too chunky for my liking i prefer them to be almost the normal size and the padding in them is great dont get me wrong it helps with digging an back pain but do they really need to be that wide this is a great buy for the price an your getting close to a v s bra no kidding i have bought these bras for years they were dream fit they sold a back smoother and a t shirt type they just married the two for this secret treasure one i overall love the fit i buy one cup smaller though otherwise it s too big i like the coverage and the straps do not dig into my shoulders bonus my biggest issue is the underwire looking at my purchase history i have bought 22 of these bras in 4 years and the reason being the underwire either snaps in two on the right side or the underwire pokes through the ends on either the inside or outside i literally have a graveyard of useless bras due to the underwire i cannot find a customer service number for secret treasures to ask them about it and walmart customer service was nice enough to give me a promo code but i have to spend 45 to get a 25 credit my most recent purchase was on may 20th after wearing 11 times i alternate to wash the underwire snapped on me today i can t seem to find anything that fits better and when i try to sew the unbroken underwires back into the bra the thread rubs me uncomfortably the underwire does not come up to the edge of the babd therefore it sticks into the breast the tag next to the hook and eyes is stiff and constantly scratcging you back i would return these bras if i had not already washed them first bra to fit me perfectly i watched a tutorial on the proper way to measure for a bra so when i purchased these they fit and are very comfortable i was delighted with the shape these gave me as well as the price i have a lot of side budge which this keeps in check quite well i haven t had to pull and tug all day like my previous bras and the straps are wide and a bit padded to prevent digging these give me a nice shape to my girls and i think this bra is simple yet pretty providing smooth lines under my clothes love the way this bra fits n ni was really happy to find that this is a proper ff bra designed for busty women rather than just an infuriating dainty design made for an a cup but scaled up to a ddd wide padded shoulder straps wide wings to cut down on the side boob a three hook closure underwires and foam cups to prevent the dreaded uni boob well done n neven though the fabric is pretty basic it s actually quite pretty there s a lacy mesh stretched over the satin fabric giving it subtle texture but not enough to show up through clothes n nwill definitely buy more of these for the price it can t be beat the straps are so comfortable for a 42ddd and a perfect fit comfortable for my large breasts good fit you will not even know you have it on color is nice and it is very comfortable straps don t go tight enough though which is annoying because it will no longer be a push up if it s too loose straps slip down needs side support option as the wires dont hold much up for long it would be comfortable with the fabric but the support is flimsy to me the bounce test was a fail too much shifting for the girls absolutely love this bra was skeptical buying online without a fitting session fits perfectly and i m buying two more today nice bargain for a great bra i really like this bra i find the fit and comfort to be perfect the problem i had is that after 2 months the underwire on the right side snapped and broke i have ordered the same exact bra because of how comfortable it is time will tell of the underwire is an issue with the new bra for a full figured woman support and comfort are not always easy to find in the same bra the secret treasures women s full figure underwire t shirt bra is the most comfortable bra i ve found with this level of support the underwires tend to break but not so soon that it makes the bra a bad purchase i ve purchased at least four of these and i m wearing one now the best thing i can say about a bra is i would rather wear it than go without and i can say that of this one the elastic is as comfortable as it can be and still support the straps don t dig into my shoulders too much and the cups are soft with no seams the reason i bought this bra the first time was the reasonable price the prices for bras for busty women can be fairly prohibitive so when i saw this it seemed logical to give it a chance i m so glad i did good bye 50 bras,women's clothing,0
420,"Hanes Women's Cotton Hi-Cut Panties, 10-Pack",15.47,3.9,929.0,i like this underwear a lot don t like the low cut at all inconsistent product good fit wrong colors disappointed this time bad quality control too small sizing would not buy again don t waste your money poor quality disappointment with panties very disappointed don t waste your money quality has decreased over time quality of this product has greatly diminished hanes hi cut panties pretty bad quality money wasted size runs very small seams varying sizes in each pack unbeatable combo,i like these very much and have been buying them for years i like the way they fit and they seem to last about a year and a half which i consider to be a good amount of time the quality is good i liked them but i do not like low riders they roll down continually and i really don t like that i didn t buy them to give away but i will have to for the reason ni did like the cotton feel though and i m sure the reciever will too i used to live hans underwear but i no longer trust what im getting they are made from very where thailand vietnam el salvador and other places and they are not consistent this latest package is from thailand it says 100 cotton i dont know what kind or quality of cotton its rough and scratchy even after a wash the sizes are not consistent i used to find the ones from vietnam was the one i liked but even now within that batch its not consistent im disappointed when i ordered i was under the impression that it was going to be all black underwear i got a variety of colors and patterns such as blues pink and white huge disappointment but the quality of the underwear is good and they fit as expected have been buying these for years and have always been very happy this time i was not there is almost a 2 variation in waist size between some of them out of the pack only two were properly sewed those are nice and fit well the rest of the pack is unwearable the elastic doesn t even line up terrible quality control hi these panties look cute but they are too small i bought that kind some years ago and they felt soft and fit properly these are more like bikini or huger they do not reach to the waist as i like it yes i know like my friend says oh you like grandma panties and yes i like panties i do not like bikini style the price is very good but i rather pay more but with more softer fabric the prints are nice i ordered size 9 as the last time for the multi pack cotton briefs i was disappointed that the sizing did not compare to the previous ones i purchased from you probably another cheaper manufacturer they have less fabric and the waist band is narrower actually with this latest batch i should have ordered a size 10 the current 9 is a bit tight and i actually weigh less than before so i can t blame an increased body hip buttocks size they fit a bit uncomfortably but as i had already washed them and now wore a couple i can t return them for a size exchange inconsistent sizing dependent on the material used to make them some were true to size others were too small because there was no stretch to the material used to make them hanes was the only underwear i would purchase but not anymore i ordered hi cut and the package was factory sealed but the white ones were panties the colored ones were hi cut one pair are cut like bikinis the quality is poor and there isn t any consistency in the size either they are supposed to be cotton but some feel rough even after washing them had i not washed them prior to noticing the size variations i would ve returned them i won t be purchasing hanes again it s obvious their quality control staff aren t doing their job i m very disappointed these panties are made from a nice cotton the patterned and solid colored panties are great fit however the white panties are another story the pantie itself fits well except every pair of white panties 4 pair in pack did not fit at waist the elastic waistband is too small and it cuts into the skin the patterned solid colored panties have a different elastic for the waistband it feels much softer and the fit is perfect i am very disappointed in the white panties it is very difficult to like them because of the tightness of the elastic i do not understand why they do not have the same fit as the colored patterned panties i can t honestly recommend them to my friends relatives due to the waistband issue of the white ones i do hope that you will adjust this issue in further manufacture of the whites i have worn hanes hi cut for years these are different they are so scratchy cheep miss sized run way to small and the elastic will never hold up total waste of money and i am sad to have to now find something new i read the reviews and still ordered 2 packs of 10 due to always have worn them boy do i regret that please do not waste your money on these the way i did i have no idea why they changed the way they made these disappointing i have purchased this same item several times within the past few years and the quality has decreased over time the material is now very thin and the fabric cut from the pattern was slightly uneven on 2 of the items in the pack and stitching was not very good on several pair these are not the hanes hi cut panties i have bought in the past the fabric is very thin and there isn t a fabric crotch liner they are very cheaply made the colors look washed out and the die isn t even consistent throughout the fabric i can t recommend these haven t used my new ones yet but based on past experiences they will be comfortable that s why i gave them a 5 star rating i also like that 10 pair come in one pack i have been wearing your panties since i was a child i am 66yr these are not up to the standards of old the material feels like paper and it has none of the normal cotton give it was not worth the effort to return during this pandemic not true to size too small had to throw them out so disappointed money wasted bought a different brand from another company and they fit fine overall is quite good value fit and style yes however i m of the belief that males must design women s underwear because these have thick uncomfortable seams why is that all men s underwear have flat seams that don t cut into their skin while women s underwear still have the bulky seams that leave horrid marks on our skin especially if you wear them under jeans there is no reason that women s underwear shouldn t have the same flat seams that men s do it would not take any more time or thread so there is no reason to not give this a try please pass this onto manufacturer s and maybe we can have comfortable undies thank you the white ones all seem true to size i wear a size 7 the assorted colors sizes are different the solid colors are sized better the all the strange pattern colors i don t know what hanes is pulling but it seems like they are buying bolts of cheapo materials so lets all root for the all white packages to make a comeback i mean we humans need to wear underwear hanes cotton panties and walmart pricing living in a tropical climate i long ago chose natural fibers to wear and i ve worn hanes hi cuts for years because i love the fit never before have i even seen a 10 pack and certainly not at the price walmart can offer average price per pair cannot be met anywhere else i have shopped and package size is great to fill lingerie drawer for a while longer than smaller quantity packs have done in the past thank you walmart for cotton at great pricing,women's clothing,0

i wear a comfortable 10 in jeans and other pants these are not too loose and not too snug material and construction seem really nice for 12 i m impressed really nice joggers i was pleasantly surprised with the fit i dont care too much for the high rise but not a deal breaker the length is great for short girls like me i am 5 x80 x99 and have an xs love these joggers i wear them all the time i m 5 10 so they hit me short but it doesn t bother me the waistband is almost like leggings so i feel like it holds my belly perfectly i bought the black in my regular size and have the grey in my cart love these theyre super comfortable and very flattering i basically live in lounge clothes and these are a new favorite of mine i purchased a l which is my normal size and they fit fine but i m going to also get an xl for the days i feel like having a looser fit defintely go up a size if you want a looser fit thin soft comfy joggers i am 5 x80 x992 x80 x9d i have them covering my belly button and they fit me right to my ankles i got them in a size medium 8 10 perfect fit comfy and love the high waist also pockets and an inner draw string to tighten the waist if needed like when you re doing yoga and don t want them to slide down 5 4 120lbs and small fits perfect super comfortable love the pockets what more could you ask for for 12 bucks only thing is i m not gonna let them go in the dryer just feels like material that would shrink in one shot i m 5 7 130lbs and the small fit on a more fitted look medium would have been baggier i love these pants budgetbabe reviewed them and i decided to buy them they are so comfortable and perfect for wearing out it s okay fits as expected order your normal size for a thin jogger look or a size up for slightly baggy i m just using it as something to wear around the house during coronavirus not sure i would wear it out for anything took them back athletic works has pants with modal and soft recycled fabrics if you really want a great jogger nthese are itchy and not soft waist too high and tight didn t look like they would wash well okay in length 5 2 and a little long i ordered my normal m size 140lbs nnot for soft somfy lounging i was constantly reminded i had them on by the constricting waist band and fabric litterally said ahhhh when i took them off nsticking with the soft crop athletic works joggers these joggers are so comfortable they are fitted like a mix between lounge pants and leggings with a fitted waist band i will be living in these pants love these joggers so much that i got a black pair too i like how the material is light weight to wear year round but not so thin that it clings to you they run tts i love the joggers they are comfortable and stylish i have 3 pair and the wash great and do not shrink i normally wear a size 26 in jeans and the xs fits perfectly the jogger wasnt the same ones i had purchased sometime earlier in store theses were more like leggings i expected them to fit loosely i cant seem to fine the ones i wanted they will be used to lounge at home i love these joggers i was skeptical buying them at first because they are so inexpensive but i m so glad that i did they are super cute comfy and fit true to size they also wash great i love them so much that i bought 3 more pairs i really like these l love the pockets and the cut is flattering the fabric is good weight and will be a year round wearable for outdoors and exercise they run small craftsmanship is decent quality and i think they will last a long time i needed new lounge pants and i loved that these were not too heavy for summer and that they are high rise joggers for a very affordable price they are very comfortable true to size and they do not bag out i want the black ones now these are very comfortable the only problem is that they do tend to come up higher on the ankle than i prefer i still wear them but i push them up a little higher on the calf they may have shortened a little in washing i like the fit a lot otherwise i love athletic work joggers but i just don t understand the sizing they fit just smaller in the legs and and not as loose around where the pockets fit either i would had perfer them to fit like the cropped ones i ordered a medium because i had gotten a medium in the gray mared color that are cropped and assumed they would fit the same but just go to the ankle instead the cropped ones are more like comfy joggers a few years back they sold these pants in different patterns and colors they are just like wearing a t shirt on your legs i love mine have every color and pattern they have sold over the past few years i am still wearing them you would never know they are 3 years old except these black ones i just bought them and they are great as well,women's

422,Signature by Levi Strauss & Co. Women's Plus Modern Bootcut Jean,21.99,4.4,263.0,nice light weight denim my go to jeans amazing jeans so so comfy perfect length for the not so tall among us short pockets runs long on inseam okay quality just ok jeans just wasnt a good fit for me great pair of jeans perfect fit plus size jeans not what i expected plus size jeans good fit and value not what i was expecting pockets not deep but true to size,love these pants if you are short like me i d suggest getting the short ones i m 5 foot 4 inches tall and the regulars dragged on the floor a little bit the jeans are exactly as pictured the denim is stretchy and light weight perfect for warm weather if you are looking for traditional levi fabric these are not it the size is a true fit for me i love these jeans very comfortable fit amazing i am short 5 4 and the short is still a little long on me but not to bad i turned around and bought 3 more pair in different washes i love these comfy jeans they have become my new favorite pair besides being comfortable they are also great quality one other pro is that they are stretchy and made to love your curves i recommend them to any woman that is looking for great jeans this review was collected as part of a promotion my go to brand i love levi s to begin with but these signature jeans are on point i love the boot cut and lately for me its been hard to find in my size i m so happy they have them for us gals on the bigger side plus i personally like the darker color so thats an added bonus in my book this review was collected as part of a promotion the jeans fit perfectly for the first time i got jeans i didn t need to shorten because they were too long the bootleg is flattering the thing i disliked most about these jeans is the front pockets they are not deep enough and could be about an inch wider i carry my smart phone in one front pocket and when out my keys and list s in the other pockets are not deep enough to prevent them from falling out quality is low for levi s brand you get what you pay for they are okay n nthey also run very long on the inseam i am 5 4 i am normally between an average and short length depending on the brand my inseam is 29 5 inchs n n nthese are short and measured 31 5 inches on the inseam way too long i had to hem them up 2 inches so i don t walk on the bottoms i want to love these jeans but that fit awkwardly they re huge in the waist and tight in the legs i carry a lot of my weight on my mid section so this isn t usually an issue i do however love the color these are nice jeans but like the other reviewers stated pockets way to small and mine were quite tight in my knees and for being short they were quite long i like the fit except for in the knees the pockets are the main reason i didnt like these i really like these jeans the material isn t heavy or stiff like jeans from years ago but it works for me i m 5 7 and the inseam is 34 which is perfect i normaly wear size 18 sometimes 16 and i ordered a size 20 because this was the 1st time i purchased levi s jean s they are a little big i have to wear a belt to keep them from sliding down on me they don t look baggy they fit me fine i actually ordered a couple more pairs i haven t washed them yet so i really can t speak on that at this time i wear a 22s i decided to order the 22s and 24s just in case the lighter jeans fit great in the 22s however the darker color jeans are tight fitting i tried on the 24s in the darker color and they are huge unfortunately i will be returning the darker pairs of jeans i order a size 24 and was nervous they wouldn t fit right since that s been my past experience with buying jeans online they are perfect not too long in the crotch don t go up over my belly button but aren t low rise at all and the don t hang down past my feet the stretchy material makes them great for work and running around with my kids i ll definitely be scooping up another pair or two in the future i am a tall 6 2 plus size woman these jeans tend to fit me better than my others the only problem is the peaky waist area they don t fit because i have to get big enough for my hips the waist is always too big they are very expensice too other than those two things i think they are good jeans fit in the waste and the short length was perfect i m 5 5 200lb and curvaceous but the fabric is very stretchy felt like the pants are constantly sliding down i have very large calves and they are very tight tried to go up to the next size but still the same issue had to return both sizes i am a tall 6 2 plus size woman these jeans tend to fit me better than my others the only problem is the peaky waist area they don t fit because i have to get big enough for my hips the waist is always too big they are very expensice too other than those two things i think they are good jeans i don t usually purchase slim fit jeans because my legs are not slender but decided to take a chance with these i was pleasantly surprised that they fit and looked really good stretch definitely helped it would be nice if the pockets were deeper but overall i was happy with my purchase fit in the waste and the short length was perfect i m 5 5 200lb and curvaceous but the fabric is very stretchy felt like the pants are constantly sliding down i have very large calves and they are very tight tried to go up to the next size but still the same issue had to return both sizes exactly as advertised sizing is true use wrinkle free spray on hemlines to prevent curling great fit would ve given 5 stars if it had deeper pockets pockets are only 2 inches deep not even deep enough to hold a maxi pad wish designers would understand women use pockets too,women's clothing,0
423,Terra & Sky Women's Plus Size Soft Full Length Legging,11.67,4.7,231.0,very comfortable so soft women s plus size soft full length legging i think i m addicted to these leggings soooo soft comfortable comfortable leggings super comfortable flattering i ordered the wrong size but still good product amazing good coverage good pants perfect leggings great fit soft and stretchy comfy walmart keep these in stock years round amazing super comfortable ans stylish new style amazing quality new material but still great,the terra sky women s plus size soft full length legging black are so comfortable i love the feeling of these pants while wearing them they are great the leggins are made very well with a nice strong stich made with great material also i like how i can basically wear these with anything they go good with all types of shirts swaeters or a jacket the best thing i like about them is how comfortable they are very nice pair of leggins i would definitely recommend if your looking for comfort pants this pants are soft hold shape and look great they can be dressed up or down and you remain comfortable they have a tapered bottom which easily tucks into boots or falls at the ankle length for shoes the high waist band is wider but very soft the weight is great because they are not heavy yet not thin allowing coverage and smoothing they are made of of 56 cotton 36 modal and 8 spandex providing the perfect softness and still hold shape they are machine washable on cold and can be dried on low they wash well not fading and keeping shape overall a great multi use pair of pants terra sky women s plus size soft full length legging black size 4x i decided to get the 4x because i wear 2x and you know how sometimes you buy stuff like this and the sizing is off well these were just a little big but i m comfortable wearing these and moving around they are comfortable the length is just right and the waist is just a little big but they are comfortable just the way they are the thing about leggings you can wear them around the house gym going out on the town etc i wear mine around the house because i like being comfortable woo hoo i absolutely love these leggings i wasn t expecting them to be as soft as they are i bought them to wear at home when i m just chilling and these are going to be perfect for that they are so comfortable and yeah i understand they are designed to be but this is my first pair of leggings and i was pleasantly surprised by exactly how soft and wonderful they were i m a large lady and i was worried about the sizing being off so i ordered up a size and while this is going to make them free and easy to move around the house and laze a few holiday days away i could have stayed with my normal size and it would have been fine i did notice that when i placed these on a particular surface it picked up a lot of lint i don t know if that s common for leggings or not but if this were a pair i wore into public i d be concerned they would allow every particle i brushed up against to stick to me i sense that i may have just started an addiction to clothing that doesn t feel like clothing and i totally understand why so many women choose to wear leggings these terra sky leggings are extremely soft and comfortable i knew as soon as i was opening the package and i felt the material that it was a good quality they we re thick enough to not see thru and super plush and soft then when i put them on my goodness these are the most comfortable pair that i own now and i have like six they fit just right for a quite curvy girl like me the size is spot on and i m not easy to fit with my dimensions i will buy another pair next shopping stint definitely a great buy i received my terra and sky women s plus size soft full length legging it is black and size 5x it is made of 56 cotton 36 model and 8 spandex jersey with a wide waistband that is very comfortable it has a 4 way stretch fabric with gusset at the crotch to boost you up with out strain the fabric is very soft it was easy to get on which i ve had a problem with others that didn t stretch as well because it comes in other colors i may get more because of the way they fit and it is a good value i ve recommended it to a few people and they are going to check them out i got the black size 0x 14w size leggings from terra sky they are high rise and fitted but not tight even though i don t have long legs i am about 5 8 tall and so often leggings are too short for me these are the perfect length they are made of 56 cotton 36 modal blended jersey and 8 spandex jersey i just know they are really soft and extremely comfortable they stretch and move with me regardless of what i m doing no uncomfort pinching or binding they have a wide waistband which i wasn t sure i would like but it is comfortable and seems to provide a bit of added support i have tried many leggings and yoga pants that are not flattering these are very flattering when it comes to my curves i was a bit concerned about the gusset at the crotch but it does not bind or cause any discomfort they came out of the wash without any issues it states they can be dried but i only dried them a short time because i have an old dryer that gets cloths very hot i then finished drying them by hanging them up they didn t wrinkle and looked great i have not had them very long but i don t have anything negative to say about these leggings i recommend these leggings i didn t realize i had ordered size 5x before i clicked confirm so that is on me i wasn t able to wear them because they were far too big but the quality of the leggings is great the fabric is soft and comfortable feeling as advertised and the seams are even and strong i have several articles of clothing from terra sky and it is a good brand that holds up well i will probably end up ordering these in the correct size because they look and feel so comfortable i have never been a fan of any sort of leggings that is until i found these they are extremely soft and so very comfortable i don t know why i waited so long to try other brands they have just the right amount of stretch in the legs and in the waistband and they are perfect for every day use i went a size up in pants just so i can have that extra comfy factor and i am so glad that i did so i would highly recommend these amazing leggings my number 1 requirement for leggings is that they pass the stretch test i stretched these to the limit and they still had good coverage the fabric is nice and soft and very comfortable for a whole day of wear my only complaint is that the length is a little short as capris these would be great even as 3 4 length but i wouldn t say they are full length if you are 5 8 or taller plan on them not hitting all the way at your ankle i recieved this pants the other day and have wore them twice pros the material feel nice and soft not ruff at all so they are definitely easy and flexible wear for all day you can dress them up or down they are are very versatile the waist band i don like very much how wide it is so it does not give the muffin top look if you have that issue it allows tops to lay nice and smoothly cons the material will pick up some lent not extremely bad and if you have pets that shed i highly recommend being careful it you are planning wearing them out i also definitely reccomend to be careful what other materials you choose to wash them with if you do not want to hand wash i will say though i did not have issue with much shrinkage in the dryer i would recommend these i would love to have a pair that are bootcut and different styles these leggings are excellent they are soft and comfortable just like it says these are perfect for lounging or paired with a oversized sweater for going out in public they hold their shape very well and are completely true to size just the right length also you dont have to spend bucks to get a perfect pair of leggings i got to try terra sky women s plus size soft full length legging in the color black this review is based on my opinion only i absolutely loved them they are so comfy the price of them is nice also nice soft breathable material fit true to size good length the elastic was a nice support held them up perfectly the black color was a nice black could be worn with a nice blouse or just lounging around i can t wait to purchase some more of these i really love that these leggings have a super wide band it makes my tummy look flatter and is more flattering for my fuller figure these are very stretchy but hold their form and fit perfect they are also a good thickness yet nice and soft i m definitely getting more of these these are soooooooooooooo comfortable and soft they fit nice and are not sse through which is a huge deal they surprising didn t shrink in the dryer pretty impressed supposed to receive on thursday september 17th but didn t receive until tuesday september 22nd as with other package there was a tear and what appeared to be a burn mark on the bag there are three spots on the leggings themselves and again as with the other package there was dirt and grit all over the leggings super comfortable i bought two pairs at the store and as soon as i wore one pair i went to walmart com and bought about 7 more pairs they are the right price right fit and so comfortable i could live in these 24 7 walmart needs to keep these in stock year round i have a bad feeling this is a one time thing and we will never see these restocked in the store i absolutely love these leggings the waistband is the perfect height to hold me in and feel comfortable the fabric is soft and a high quality they feel so expensive and comfortable i am going to purchase the camo print too nplease make these leggings in more colors they are my new go to leggings these are a newer version of the older style leggings i prefer these they mimic the quality of old navy yoga pants they are stretchy and true to size i

greatest top walmart sells for fall worthwhile purchase cozy and soft perfect,a great find so warm soft comfortable to wear love the look the length and the long sleeves so happy i found these i usually wear a medium sometimes large but had to go with extra large because of the choices left so glad i did definitely runs small if you like it comfortable and larger which fits the look nothing is hanging the way it is made fits well i got the blue and pink will get the black i will not put them in the dryer i think it will affect the perfect fit i want to wear them all of the time that comfortable and cozy i live in these duds in the winter their soft fuzzy texture creates and holds warmth i love the texture next to my skin i also wear them under a sweatshirt when i go outside and i can count on them to keep the chill away inside i can cut the heat way down and still stay toasty i like the thumb hold too which keeps them down over my wrist so no drafts creep up the sleeve i love all the different patterns too i have one for every day of the week now like i said i live in these things theyre just that comforting these are just as advertised they run true to size i got the extra large and i wear a size 16 18 they are the softest fleece and i love that they are flexible so they dont feel tight the sleeves are long but because of the stretch they are easy to pull up they certainly keep the chill out i just purchased more because i was so pleasantly surprised if they had more colors i would order more i bought 3 of these pink blue and wine they are soooo soft warm and cozy happy that they came in colors other than the typical black and blue that are at our pearisburg walmart ni sleep in these hang out at home and wear them when i go out loooove them and looooove walmart thank you walmart for carrying these and thank you cudl duds for making them lock desktop it is so soft warm comfortable i m at 38 double d this size fits me nice i had surgery so my stomach is a little swollen and chubby so so i have to get a certain size to coordinate with my bust size and my stomach size 5 top to fit me right sun tops they fit at the top but it s not on the stomach waist i already wrote a review for these i bought several they are great i live in them in the winter because they are so soft warm and comforting the thumb hold keeps drafts from going up my arm i love these things have a different pattern for every day of the week i highly recommend them pants too this item is awesome keeps you warm it s soft yeah because i am a 38 double d besides i purchase that s fine but they should put on their size chart a little more easier chastise on the chart what bra size you are events that i would be more helpful call yahoo customer service to practice the correct size and put away that they can figure out if they re a little chunky around the waist to coordinate the correct size i love the softness and cozy comfort of this product i am 5 4 and my size on the top is usually a small this time i ordered the small and the arms were a bit long but i kept it anyway since it fit great everywhere else the bottoms i ordered an extra small and they are true to size i wear them just to lounge around the house and you couldn t buy anything more comfortable i should know with multiple outfits of cuddl duds don t hesitate and enjoy i ordered a medium but was sent a small the top stretches so its not too tight but i would have preferred more room the color is deep and rich what i like best is the material is extremely light weight but warm i keep my house on 63 degrees and am comfortable in this top very soft and snuggly too this color is not bright like the colors in the picture its light pink and light gray looks like camouflage instead of black and bright pink and it runs small instead of true to size i wear a 3x but i ordered a 4x just to be sure and it was too small not happy just love these they are the same as the cuddle duds they sell at kohls but for a 1 4 of the price i have many in different colors i wash them in cold water and air dry to keep them looking good for years i usually wear a medium but buy a large so i can put a nonfleece climate right underneath for extra warmth these are really soft and feel good on the skin this is an excellent price i have paid twice as much in the past i also like that they come in more colors i especially like the navy i like to wear these as a regular shirt instead of as underwear so i bought one size larger i am 5 feet and 120 lbs and wear a large i usually wear a large but i sizes up so it would fit more like a sweatshirt than an undershirt it is incredibly comfortable and fits just like i want it too the fabric is the same as cuddl duds fleece very soft thin but warm this climateright brand seems to be for tall slender women with long torso i m 5 1 looooove these shirts i bought 3 happy to see other colors on line my walmart store in pearisburg sells only black and navy warm soft and cozy what else could you ask for cozy during cold weather here in wisconsin it s amazingly comfy and it keeps me warm without getting too hot no wonder it s called climate right

426,"Time and Tru Women’s Animal Print Feather Flats, Available in Wide Width",14.97,4.3,189.0,fits comfortable nice business casual flats on point looks expensive dress up and dress down fits snug snake print shoes comfortable able but runs small okay pair of shoes doesn t fi even for regular size cute shoes pretty flat shoes stylish shoes gorgeous shoes high quality low price expensive and stylish looking flats cute little flats my second purchase of this style cool shoes,the time and tru animal print feather flats are very stylish and can be worn as casual or formal i like that even with my wide foot they fit comfortable and are not to tight the memory foam inside makes them extremely soft on my feet and comfortable even wearing without socks i love that these are flat with no heal i can walk all day without any discomfort easy to keep clean just by wiping with a wet cloth all and all i am very satisfied with the quality and make of these shoes these flats look very nice on my feet and fit well they are made with memory foam insoles which i think would be comfortable to wear at work in a business casual setting they also would look nice with a business casual outfit for an interview or any other business casual event they are comfortable made well and look nice these pointy toe loafers are comfortable i bought them in an 8 5 and they are true to size they look and feel more expensive than they are no one would ever know i paid 9 00 for them them the leopard print is super cute too ive been wearing them a lot its nice to be able to stay on trend without having to spend a lot of money these shoes are very sleek and look like they are high end designer shoes they have memory gel inside but it is so thin that it is hard to tell i like the look of the shoe but they are a bit stiff and i am not sure if they will be easy to break in i usually wear a size 11 and these were just a touch too tight they are nice and easy to slip on and i will definitely wear them for shorter events however i feel like they would not be beneficial to wear all day what i like about these time and tru flats is that they go well with several different outfits you can dress up and dress down they go well with pants and also with a dress they have a classic look with a modern twist snake print the memory foam insole makes it very comfortable on the bottom even though at first they don t seem to be true to size they seemed kind of small after a few uses i realized it is indeed true to size i normally wear a 7 and i got these in 7 my only concern is that it is very tight as these type of shoes need to be so they don t fall off of the feet and it took about three uses for me to break them in and for them to start to feel comfortable first couple of uses my heels hurt a little but it gets better i guess this is a problem we have to face with any new pair of shoes but rest assured that it gets better i thought the toes would be compressed in the front because of the shoe format but i didn t have any issues with that i was worried it would look like cheaply made but that s not the case it looks pretty and fancy what you would expect from an expensive brand name pair of shoes but at a fraction of the price now i just have to wait for the weather to get better again so i can wear these shoes more often love the snakeskin print i got these in size 9 regular width i have narrow feet and they are a bit snug and stiff and rub on the backs of my ankles a bit they probably need to be worn in hopefully that will help i personally would size up a half size or try the wide too just to compare these shoes were very cute they have a memory foam padding which actually makes them feel better they have a very pointy toe but does not squish the toes my foot is very flat no arch support at all i feel this made the shoe kinda come out on side but overall easy to wear and very cute the time and tru animal print feather flat shoes are really cute and they re actually very comfortable the only thing i d say about these though is to order a size up from what you need i ordered a half size up than i usually wear because they re so pointed at the end but they were still a little snug if you order these online i d say order at least a half size larger than your normal shoe size great shoe though they re easy to wear don t hurt my feet and they bend easily on the bottom i really like time and tru animal print feather flat shoes i m normally a size 7 5 so that s what i ordered they run about one half of a size too big while they will still work for me they are slightly long and a bit wide i do have fairly narrow feet but not enough to order narrow width shoes they do look more expensive than they are and you can dress them up or down i love jeans so i will mostly be wearing them with that i wouldn t rely on these shoes for more than four straight hours of walking because they don t really feel that durable however they would more than satisfy a casual night out with intermittent sitting i would recommend these shoes to those on a budget and those who are looking for a nice pair of shoes for short events they are very narrow even for the regular size i am wearing a 7 5 but barely could fit in 8 0 looks like i should take 9 0 not comfortable rough material i would not recommend it yes it looks nice but your feet are small enough you can go for it these are cute snakeskin print flats they are comfortable enough to wear all day i wore them with jeans leggings and dresses they are a black gray print with a rubber sole i got these shoes for my daughter who is a size 6 and a half they seemed a little bit big on her but she ll grow into them shoes have memory foam cushion for an insole which is quite comfortable the shoes have a pretty snakeskin design i requested a size 6 and they fit perfectly mostly i wear them to work with some black slacks and they add a little something extra to my outfit the are comfortable for daily wear and it s easy to slide in and out of them i m obsessed with this print i can t believe i found these shoes gorgeous great fit and i get so many compliments the fit was on point and they don t pinch i m wearing them all day everyday i bought these to replace last years time these have a nice flair and an expensive look nice finish the only negatives i ve noticed is they re pretty pointed so you can kind of tell that on your toes but i have a wide foot if you have a medium or narrow foot you d never notice they gap a little but again that may be my wide foot they are a bit snug but i used to fit shoes at a shoe store and flats should always be a little snug in the beginning these were so cute in person i tried them on 7 wide and they fit great ni have very weird feet and its hard for me to find cute fashion shoes they seem pretty comfy from nwhat i could tell so i decided to purchase them walked around some and then decided to buy them ni really do like them alot and would recommend them this pair of shoes are very pretty and extremely comfortable i picked these for office wear and they go well with shirts and trousers i happened to see another design these ones in the same style and picked i am in size 6 5 and my feet are on the narrow side and these fit very well i also wear a foot with these shoes love these shoes in fact have them on right now very fashionable i get lots of compliments as mentioned by another reviewer the are a little tight and not very giving i kind of fold them back and forth a bit before putting them on to loosen them up hopefully they will loosen up on their own as time goes on love them i had read on one of the reviews to order a 1 2 size up good advise,women's clothing,0

428,Playtex Womens 18 Hour Classic Support Wire-Free Bra Style-2027,19.65,4.3,2274.0,playtex 18 hour bra style 20 27 best bra for mastectomy patients my one and only style old fashioned perfect good bras but cups seems to run big still wearing many many years cups too big returned really rough and stiff material defect not satisfied great support bra great bra for women with bigger breasts the 18 hour 4693 is better bra has a strange odor disappointed zero stars mis sized with strong smell to many hooks my favorite i do recommend but watch the cups run big the cup is pointier not rounded like the picture,this is an oldie but goodie i have worn this bra 20 27 for years but you cannot find it in the stores i was thrilled to see it on your site i ordered 3 to see if it was the same as i was used to it was so i just ordered 5 more i have wore these bras for many years they are getting impossible to find in the stores so happy to find them on your website my cousin had both breasts removed these bras work perfect for her silicone falsies they are far better than the mastectomy bras we bought the liner holds them in place thank you so much for the fantastic pricing too it s has been my one and only style for over 20 years for a fuller figure women the support is fabulous and the sizes are there for everyone and they don t lose their shape i have some that are over 5 years old fantastic support with no underwires straps wide back are comfortable stay in place true to size i bought these for my mother who is 83 yrs old this is the size bra she wears and she loves the brand sadly the cups were huge o her and i had to send them back this is the size cup she wears but u fortunately they were just not right for her i do recommend the brand but id be careful of the cup size 4 stars instead of 5 because after several washings it seems the bottom band develops a tendency to curl i ve worn this same style bra for more years than i m willing to admit i really wanted to like this bra but like most all the others i ve tried the cup sizes are too big i normally wear a c but got a b due to what i ve been experiencing with bras over the past few years and still the b was too big it s very frustrating i have returned this one too i bought one of these in my size the material was really rough but i wanted to give it a good try the band seemed to fit me correctly but the cups were a bit big at the end of the day i took it off and noticed significant pain in the skin under one of the girls i looked closer and saw that the bra had not only rubbed this area raw but it also dug a hole in the skin never had any bra do that to me before even with an underwrite i think i ll stick with bali i was so excited to get this bra however what a complete disappointment to open the plastic box and find that it was not right the air form liner had not ben sewn and it was literally 2 pieces of material instead of one assuming that i would not have any problems i had thrown away the plastic box and my receipt darn the luck this showed a 4 hook bra but in the specifications it does state 3 5 hooks so i just rolled the dice and hoped for the best i lost i have bought playtex bras in the past and have been satisfied but this one doesn t even fit to size its a bit smaller and uncomfortable have been wearing this bra for many many years needing a large size has limited the styles i could buy this particular bra has always given me the support i need i am a large busted woman and these are the only bras i can find in my size great support and comfort they hold up vert good after washing i can t express how excited i am to finally have a bra that fits and has such great support after just a few hours my boobs were sagging in this bra it did not provide good support like the 18 hour 4693 which i have been buying for years i just cannot find a better bra than that one this is not the playtex bra i remember it is very stiff even after washing twice also there is a very strange odor coming from the bra of gasoline kerosine going to soak the bra in fabric softener and hope for a better outcome needless to say i m disappointed although i ordered a generous band size and i have always ordered playtex bras in the past not only was the band size too tight but the cup size was too small i can barely fasten the very first hooks and i m over flowing over the bra on the sides and underarms i was incredibly disappointed with the bra the bra smells horribly a chemical putrid smell that makes the bra unwearable in addition the bra band is approximately 3 4 inches smaller than the playtex 18 hour bra that it is replacing i ordered two bras of different styles and they both were too small than the band measurement should be and emitted the same strong stench n something has gone wrong with playtex s sizing and quality control an embarrassment for the company and a problem that seems to have been going on for a while i guess i should have read the reviews before buying and not rely in the company s reputation and my satisfaction with prior purchases i did not realize it had so many hooks i wore one out of 3 i bought other 2 are unworn very uncomfortable on my back i can t wait to remove absolutely the best bra out there for large breasts firm uplifting wire free and comfortable the cups seems to suddenly run a little big ive not lost weight and bought the size i always wear but this time the cup was just big on me ni sent the bra back and was refunded promptly i was so excited to get my new bras i was kind of disappointed when i put one on because in the pictures it shows they are rounded looking but mine look pointier with the way the cup is,women's clothing,0
429,Blissful Benefits by Warner's® Women's No Muffin Top Brief 3-Pack,11.96,4.5,518.0,most comfortable underwear ever so glad i found these i ll be buying more ladies full briefs good fit awesome fitting undies perfect fit no wedgies super cute stay up and comfy pretty and functional with staying up power extremely disappointed not the same underwear too big my mistake nice looking panties fit okay what happened to comfortable underwear what happened to comfortable underwear fits great super comfy perfect fit super comfortable sizing information is confusing and not accurate comfy,i love these underwear and have been buying them for 2 years now they are very comfortable and do not ride up or down the wide band is so comfortable with no elastic to cut into you they have also been a great price but when i ordered them they were charging triple of what i had been paying although they said they were on clearance i hope you are not going to stop carrying them i ordered them anyway even though they were marked up i spent forever looking for a pair of nude colored briefs to wear under a pair of white capris it was harder than i anticipated i m plus size wear a 20 22 in most jeans i ordered the 2x and i actually really like them they take a little bit to get used to because they are a little snug but they really seem to smooth out my butt and lower tummy more than 5 stars nthey are the best briefs i ve bought in ages ni love everything the fabric the style the comfortable fit quality and price nfor me they are perfect and true to size ni love the waistband thus full coverage briefs are more than wonderful i only wore cotton until these there is a sheen and smoothing effect of these and they are comfortable cool as well buy a size up the no muffin top is true doesn t show thru my leggings plan to buy more great style i love these undies so comfortable and the fit is unbelievable ni did notice with my last purchase they have made fabric change but i was able to find some of the same i had at home nas far as size i was wearing a vanity fair style pantie these fit much better and i bought the same size i love warners underwear great fabric perfect fit and mo wedgies they hold up to washing and drying so well ni just buy new ones because i like the new colors but i keep the old ones because they are still in great shape please never stop carrying the best brand of underwear i m a paraplegic and have great difficulty finding underwear that stay up when i m dragging myself up the bed into my sleeping position n nthese underwear are cute comfortable and do what they need to do i don t feel like i m wearing granny panties i m a paraplegic and have great difficulty finding underwear that will stay up even when i m dragging myself up into my sleeping position and even when i m sitting in a chair all day n nthese particular ones are cute comfortable and i love them if you have been a fan of this brand of underwear for as long as i have prepare to be terribly disappointed the next time you buy a package i m not sure why but they are completely different now very low quality terrible uncomfortable fabric and fit very little stretch they ride up on your bottom and cut into your tummy i was devastated to find that my favorite underwear are now ruined i read a review that said to size up so i did they re way too big however the material is nice and they are comfortable i would strongly suggest doing your best to choose the correct size i d say they are probably rather close to adequate size description i guess a lot depends on your body type i will buy these again but i will downsize i thought panties were a bit tight when pulling up and had to adjust them perhaps i needed a size larger but wearing them is fine they feel okay the description of microfiber threw me off a bit as i was expecting something more stretchy not so these panties are more like a nylon maybe sizing up would have been a better choice for a 2x they were horribly small the fabric was too slick not at all a good fit really disappointed returned two of the 3 packages because i opened the other will donate the ones i didnt try on and throw away the other n noh and the no muffin top thing is a crock they rolled like a criminal in the hot seat for a 2x they were horribly small the fabric was too slick not at all a good fit really disappointed returned two of the 3 packages because i opened the other will donate the ones i didnt try on and throw away the other n noh and the no muffin top thing is a crock they rolled like a criminal in the hot seat i like blissful benefits no muffin top micro brief s the wide waist band helps keep my side s from spilling over and they are very comfortable i haven t had to constantly pull up my underwear because the wide band lay s snuggly around my waist so they stay still the high waisted briefs also keep you from having plumber s crack if you re bending down or bending over they provide all the coverage you need this review was collected as part of a promotion this product is amazing i have a muffin top like most woman don t want to say but this product helped me hid it and still makes me feel sexi i love this product i recommend this to all of my friends and family this review was collected as part of a promotion one of the things i absolutely hate about underwear and being a bigger woman is that most of the time the underwear do not fit right and with my bigger stomach the underwear always roll down and then i have to constantly fix them in this busy world even i don t have time to have to do that all of the time well with these underwear that is not an issue i weigh almost 200lbs and these underwear have not rolled down one single time they are silky extremely comfortable and i have never had to adjust them while wearing them another problem which i am not sure if it is a problem for everyone when wearing underwear or just a problem for bigger people is that underwear frequently give me a wedgie again these totally surprised me because i haven t gotten a wedgie at all with these these truly are the best of the best when it comes to underwear and that includes the comfort the fit and the feel i see more of these being added to my undergarments in the near future and definitely plan on telling more people about these bonus that they came in a 3 pack with different colors this review was collected as part of a promotion recently tried the microfiber briefs from blissful benefits by warner s and i really love these they almost feel like silk are super comfortable and give me the stretch i need they constrict and move with me absolutely love these this review was collected as part of a promotion information listed for sizing is confusing size 5 6 was listed as small the

430,"Radiant by Vanity Fair Women's Full Figure 2-Ply Back Smoothing Underwire Bra, Style 3476571",14.03,4.4,405.0,made for me smoothing underwire bra the best bra my go to bra love this bra soooo comfy comfortable and supportive as expected comfortable enough issues with new item vanity fair bra perfect size fit good not my permanent choice works it s a very good bra for the price wish i didn t buy multiples before i tried wearing excellent bra great bra and price tight bra finally a fit,i have a very hard time finding a comfortable bra that fits me i m sure everyone likes something a bit different i do like an underwire this one is very good there is nothing i really dislike about it i can wear it all day with no pain or rolling i have bought one in each color i really like that this bra is smoothing without a thick layer of padding it s very comfortable and stretches just a bit for the perfect fit it seems to run true to size because i ordered my usual size and it fits perfectly the underwire ads that little bit of extra support as well i am required to mention that i did receive this bra for purpose of review however my opinions are entirely my own and considering my experience i would definitely recommend this bra this review was collected as part of a promotion i ve been buying this bra for 8 years it s one of most comfy durable affordable not padded bra for a full figured girl like me i range from a 42ddd to a 40dd depending on how healthy i am at the time i really hope they don t stop making these this is my favorite bra ever i literally just buy this style in different colors because it offers good support while being comfortable i hate being braless so i wear it to bed as well it s that comfortable i don t even think about it nthe only negative is when they become older the underwires begin to pop out and then i have to get rid of them i bought this bra because i am losing weight and a lot of my bras don t fit right anymore i read reviews and everyone raved about it so i gave it a shot i have to admit i wish i had bought more than one because i love it for the price you can t go wrong i plan on buying more definitely back smoothing very supportive and comfortable this is my 6th one over 8 or so years usually buy 2 at a time and they really last smooth front too no lumps or texture even clingy shirts slide over for a couple years now this is the only bra i wear it s comfortable and supportive for a full figured woman i have been accustomed to buying this bra under curvation in amazon i am glad that that continue under vanity fair as this has been my main bra for yrs however i feel as though there has been a slight design change two differences the cup fits better and before where i would have used the shortest adjustment for the clasp at the back i now use the longest one but i will keep buying as i still love it comfortable soft bra and the strap adjuster s stay put i has decent support too if it would have a little more lining it would have definately got a 5 it s not so thin that you can see through it just could have used a little thicker lining for a bit more descretness i bought 3 of them the lining on the outside will not lay smooth i smooth it out and still shows bunched on part of the cup the outside of it like it was not sewn tight so it doesnt lay flat no matter what i do this bra slid up my back very uncomfortable this is my second size of this bra both size slid up my back they fix perfectly it isn t easy for me to find my size 36 g and for less then 20 i m so happy i got 3 decent bra for the price great fit good for emergencies until you can get to mall and fork out 40 there should be more cushioning around the wire because after you wear it a while it causes irritation where the wire meets the skin not my favorite bra the underwires are uncomfortable under my arms by the end of the day this is my go to bra fits beautifully it holds up to many many wash and dry s and keeps it shape nicely nit has the best support i have found in a larger size bra as well i have shopped online and had a really hard time i saw this at walmart and without trying it on i got it home and it was perfect comfortable and inexpensive i m going back to get more it doesnt support its claims no lift and support it just runs small too small the straps slip it is pretty though you just have to break it in i guess absolutely one of the most comfortable underwire bras i have ever owned nsoft cloth covered wires nstraps that stay in place nstrap adjustments that can be made in front n3 hook closure ni tried one loved it and bought 3 more nmy size is a 44d really nice bra for the price i bought several in different colors very comfortable they wash and dry well i have a hard time finding a bra that doesn t irritate my skin from the underwire these bras fit well,women's clothing,0
431,"Hanes Women's Cotton Boy Brief, 6-Pack",13.98,3.5,921.0,happy i would not purchase again they are ok but i wouldnt buy a again they re okay loose fitting and cottony comfort very disappointed too cheaply made size chart incorrect not the same quality anymore seriously nope nope not as advertiseds advertised rough fabric good look and feel these boy briefs are terrible too like baggy knees in your favorite pants not bad it works for me,i would suggest get one size smaller than what you normally get i wear a seven and i got a seven and they re way too big get one size under but other than that i love them very comfortable these are amazing i have been brand loyal for years and years jockey but these are simply wonderful nthe fit is exactly what is described the waistband creates a smooth transition to my waist no muffining no matter what i am wearing these look great jeans leggings shorts these are the second package i have purchased and i am thinking about getting another just in case these become discontinued these are poorly made in one package i got three pairs that are clearly different sizes see picture they fit weird like they are big in the front n small in the bacc i have a big butt so i got a 6 instead of 5 they colors i got i liked purchase at your own risk n also i wanted them to fit like shorts but thts not possible how they are built especially tht seam in the front i bought these to wear to bed thinking they d be cute and comfortable with a tee this material is not soft like i was expecting not sure why i was expecting these to feel different then the men s boxers my boyfriend wears but they don t it s the same material they haven t softened up after a couple washes either they look cute and fit good when you first put them on but stretch out in the butt fairly quickly so then it s a little saggy i should ve returned them n ni would still recommend them if this is what you re looking for in the material hanes is pretty good brand imo and i would expect these to last like the men s line just beware they re not soft like you i might expect these were just what i was expecting but i should have ordered one size larger they are thick not very stretchy and the crotch panel tends to be loose and baggy they are perfect for sleeping in and that is what i love them for they would not be comfortable under snug fitting clothes but are fine under something loose if you like a bit of breeze bought because i expected to receive the colors pictured or at least different colors than the ones than they sell on amazon the 6 pairs of underwear got progressively larger the underwear material is stiff possibly from the dye don t purchase if you don t want to receive colors other than the colors pictured don t purchase if you want your underwear size not to be inconsistent my bad for not reading enough of the reviews i have worn hanes women s boxers for 15 years and each time i buy them they have less and less quality now i have 12 pair that stretch out at the legs and do not stay snug in the past they were made from high quality thick cotton and stayed snug throughout the day i will not be buying your brand again size chart provided by walmart and hanes is completely incorrect attached is the correct one that comes with the product only that it is already too late when you realized you bought the wrong one because you followed the size chart provided here very disappointed with both hanes and walmart i have been a hanes customer since the early 90 s my products have lasted for years i bought boy shorts in 2010 that actually look like boxer briefs without the opening in the front cute still in great condition decided to buy more received them today 8 21 20 not the same quality cotton as the first batch bought in 2010 feels like paper poorly put together no feminine curve to the design not even a logo on the band in the pic the top one is the 2020 purchase and package it came in the bottom is the 2010 purchase same size m 8 very disappointing i purchased these because the ones i ve purchased before were great but these are not 100 cotton as advertised they re 5 spandex not sure if they changed the fabric used or sent me the wrong ones now i can t return them because i threw the package away thanks walmart i have purchased these before and with my recent purchase they were poorly made and they were all different sizes one pair could fit a child and the next pair could fit a 200 lb adult there s no consistency in sizing i don t recommend these i expect better from a well known company these are the literal worst they stretch out and loose their shape in about 10 minutes and all the extra fabric finds its way into your crevices n nand you re welcome for my exclusion of photos i was ready to love these but they are not 100 cotton they contain polyester and so i can not use them unfortunately i depended on the description here and they have already been laundered not happy with this purchase at all the price was nice and that s probably why the fabric is so rough i thought maybe it would soften up after a wash but that just made the waist band stretch out the fabric and the color looks faded these are brand new but they look like they had years of wear disappointed i bought a hanes product like these many years ago and found them to be the perfect item to sleep in when the ones i had started to show wear and tear i looked for a similar product to replace them and found these to be perfect i didn t really need 6 pairs so gave 2 pairs to friends and they love them too too big and bulky i bought medium because that s the size i ve purchased in the past in another boy brief style but the underwear stretches out as you wear it and the crotch feels huge and lumpy and doesn t conform to my body it just sags and makes your pants fit weird the waistband is not comfortable at all it s a wide piece of elastic that s scratchy and has a big seam where it s sewn to the top of the underwear which rubs you the fabric is thick and terrible and adds to the bulky feeling under your clothes these might be okay to wear to sleep in but definitely not for wearing under actual clothes unless you like the feeling of having a pair of ill fitting shorts on under your jeans donating these because i can t wear them do not but these hanes has changed over the years and their underwears feel like tissuepaper almost and stretch out easily making them baggy almost like those leggings you loved and no longer fit because the elasticity is gone yeah those i like and will most likely continue to wear hanes underwear until i die but i do not like the feel of these 100 cotton boy shorts on my skin i can t explain why it s different from wearing the briefs which feel softer on my skin i have bought these before they are what they say they are i like them and they fit me properly they are 00 cotton i have allergies and the cotton works for me they do not have elastic around the legs and that works for me the size runs true,women's clothing,0
432,Blissful Benefits by Warner's® Women's Underarm Smoothing Underwire Bra RA3561W,10.46,4.5,388.0,favorite brand perfect bra warehouse worker great bra boob lift so so happy with this bra fabric color you cannot return clothing because of corona virus these don t last long highly recommend comfy best bra at reasonable price very comfortable lives up to its promises cheaply made nice bra soft and very comfortable feels so comfortable most comfortable bra i ve had in a long time nice bra but not for me,what is really great about this bra is that it lifts and it has side contours to help with keeping everthing in it really is a full coverage bra that i am wearing every day now the size around is accurate so i would not recommend ordering smaller best thing about this brand is the wires have never poked through that s why i keep returning to this brand when i need a new one highly recommend these are my absolute favorite bras none of my friends can believe that i buy all my bras from walmart i don t take great care of my bras so i don t feel bad when it s time to replace them since they re so cheap i have them in all the colors i m at that age but with this bra everything disappeared best underarm coverage ever so comfortable at my 10 hr a day warehouse job i already ordered 3 more it is my best bra i have normally i cant find one but this bra is best for me because it allows space between my boobs so my heart doesnt speed up from me being to hot there hahaha tmi i know right why go to victoria secret and empty your checkbook when you can get this for a fraction of the cost it gives you just as much support and is comfortable i choose to spend my money on good things and this is one of those this is my favorite bra i have been buying these for the last 5 6 years and compared to the other bras i bought that are so expensive this bra in my opinion beats them by far i was very heavy about 270lbs and these bras actually fit so nice they didnt leave rolls of fat along my back straps they actually smoothed them i loved the fit held everything in place now that im thin again 130 lbs these bras still deliver an outstanding fit so comfortable and true to its size light weight but full coverage ni love love love this brand the underwires are uncomfortable i thought these were the padded underwires that hanes has in other bras i guess i misinterpreted the description i do like the straps that you can reconfigure nwill still wear this but wish the wnderwires were padded it fits good but i ordered it twice in two sizes different for me and my mom and mine came with a yellow stain and my moms its mostly yellow and in some areas white im hopping this color could change when i wash it but its really a disappointment to find this also im not in the country so i cant return it i really like these bras but they are huge i bought a 36b and it fit like a 38c i tried to return them to a walmart store like it said i could but they informed me they were not taking returns on clothing at this time tops of cups came apart within 2 months and i launder bras in a longerie bag on delicates cycle these were comfortable but since they did not last they are not practical to buy disappointing because i liked the comfort the smoothness and not having the underarm side bulge while wearing summer shirts my fave bras i have been buying them for a few years and i replaced all my others with them just bought new ones bc i lost a lot of weight and needed a smaller size they re super comfortable and have great support and look good under anything i won t buy anything else sooo comfy i recently gained weight which gave me boobs before i was barley an a cup and would always wear very padded bras this is the first lightly lined bra in a long time and i feel soo good in it my boobs also are wide apart and kinda go under my armpits but the underarm smoothing band makes them stay in the front i wear a 34 b and normally wear the hook on the loosest hook but because the band is stretchy i have to hook it on the tightest hook so i would size down in the band i used to only wear victoria s secret bras not wanting to pay that much i tried on one of these bras at wal mart loved it so bout it in tan later purchased 3 more online in different colors originally i got the wrong size fitting rooms are closed now but the exchange process is so easy in walmart so i got the right one at my next visit i m super happy with my purchase great quality this has become my favorite bra it is soft smooth and holds everywhere in place the only thing i dislike is the area of the underwire seems to become misshapen over time maybe that is just a hint that its time for a new one it fit larger around than my other 40c brands started falling apart after the 2nd wash it was comfortable but i had to throw it away so not worth the money even if it was inexpensive for a warner bra i really love this bra well probably it s not a sexy bra but it works really good nnice material really soft and comfortable nand in addition i love the price i ordered three of these from walmart com after receiving one to try and review this is a beautiful line of of intimates from warners ordered in tan black and white straps are comfortable and they stay put the underarm smoothing panel really works to smooth under the arm ordered in size 36c fits perfectly i wish the walmart stores had these they use to carry them made from 78 rayon 22 elastane the sides 76 rayon and 24 elastane again very pretty and comfortable i recommend this bra for comfort and style washes in cold water air dry i can t find anything negative to say about this bra i love the material it is soft and non binding i love the extra coverage on the sides and back that it provides the fact that it doesn t have that extra seam under the arm with a plastic stay in it that gets bent and pinches you is a great plus for me as those things always hit in the most uncomfortable way and usually cause much irritation n nit wraps around and hugs you is the only way i know how to describe it it doesn t roll down and let the back fat spill over for me like other bras that have the stays and are stiffer materials the cups are not too thick or bulky like some of the foam cups can be and they are a great fit not too low or too high cut and i think will work well with most necklines unless you are wearing a super deep plunging one the straps are stretchy but not too stretchy and are adjustable to create a perfect fit for anyone n nit s proportioned in such a way that it is an excellent bra for any figure from full figure to petite i think it is an all around good fit nall and all a great bra i normally wear warners bras style 1593 in size 34c and it s an almost perfect fit it is a full coverage padded underwire bra which i really needed 5 years after having a baby let s just say the girls weren t as perky as they were before having a child and breast feeding while i don t usually have an underarm pudge problem i do find it really hard to find a bra that fits me just right a demi bra fits me well in the underarm area but i need full coverage otherwise the girls flop out when i bend over and most full coverage bras come up too high in the underarm area and cut me at the armpits n ni ordered the warners blissful benefits underarm smoothing bra size 34c nude color the color was perfect and blended nicely with my skin so you couldn t see it through a thin white t shirt it provided ample coverage the underwire was comfortable and the cup size was right on target for me the padding was a little thin but i am used to a heavily padded bra even so the blissful benefits did its job and did it well the underarm smoothing feature was a really nice perk unfortunately it was a little too high for me i think it would be a great feature for someone that finds a general full coverage bra fits well while i am normally a 34 i think i could have used a 32 in this bra because i found it was a little loose and tended to slide around during the course of the day i ve worn the bra twice and washed it twice i put it in the wash machine in a delicate bag with my other bras on the delicate cycle and it came out fine all things considered i d recommend this bra to someone else but i don t think i d purchase it for myself because it wasn t the perfect fit for me i m 5 4 tall 135 lbs hopefully this review will help you find the right bra,women's clothing,0
433,No Boundaries Juniors' High Rise Skinny Jeans,9.88,4.3,461.0,it ok for curvy girls on size 15 sucks it in my favorite jeans stylish pants but don t stretch one bit great feel but runs small fits well and serves its purpose small waist disappointing weirdly sewn foot won t fit through nice jeans great pants couldnt put my foot through got stuck on my heel love the jeans beware different sizes weird designs that cut into my thighs size not hr but lr very small for a size 13,im a curvy girl and i was afraid that this jeans dont fit but was good the pant fit ok but i think that i have to use one more size i bought size 15 i think that i have to use size 17 bought them size 17 equivalent to size 12 in levi s omg these jeans hold me in i m 53 years old and i feel like i just slapped on a faja girdle you can see the difference in my levi s vs these ni highly recommend these jeans go buy you some these are my new favorite jeans hands down they fit like a glove i m 5ft 3in 105 lbs 25in waist 33 5in hips i ordered my regular size size 1 and i m truly satisfied with the quality the fit the appearance nearly everything the 1 thing that bothers me is the ankle holes are strangely tight with not much stretch in the hem though the rest of the jeans minus the waistband is pretty stretchy they really accentuate what little curves i have lol these jeans are amazing i own the light wash ones i am 5 x80 x994 x80 x9d and 130 lbs and i bought a size 9 they fit perfect theyre stretchy and so comfy i want to buy more colors the jeans look great however they are super tight as they don t stretch be sure to go up a size if you want some extra wiggler room these have no wiggle room felt great but small at the waist order up a size nit fit perfect everywhere throughout the legs but it was too tight on me when i buttoned it can t bend and work in them ni will try to exchange them for a size bigger i purchased size 13 in these black high rise skinny jeans they fit me well my measurements are 33inches waist 44 inches hips and i usually wear 30 inches inseam for my pants i am 5ft 3 and the pants reaches me below my ankle it reaches me above my navel and is very flattering i am ready to find a cute little crop top to go with these jeans n nquality the pants is well made and has enough stretch to wiggle into it has a very rich black color so it definitely does not look faded the only thing about black pants that i always notice is that they have a strong dye odor i had to do some serious spraying to keep the odor at bay it also is a bit of a lint magnet but nothing serious that a lint remover can t handle it is a decent budget pants that serves its purpose the label warns about the color getting on other items of clothing so you may want to wash it with other dark preferably black only clothing nice material for the price but super small waist the waist for size 7 was 12 across laid flat and doesn t stretch was not flattering at all for me will return i want to like these pants and were it not for a few defects i would n nthey fit well have a bit of stretch in the material and i love the dark rinse color but one of the pocket liners shows when worn and one pant leg is about two inches longer than the other it s not worth the hassle to return them and the defects can be masked in the cooler months pants tucked into boots and pocket hidden under a jacket n ni ordered these online and feel that had i bought them in store i wouldn t have these issues small ankle holes bought my daughter her usual size 0 1 and she couldn t get her foot through the foot hole the jeans are weirdly sewn she managed it up to her heel it will not stretch we ve bought these same jeans before in black and they fit her perfect so strange returning them very comfy based on another review i ordered a size or two up because i m a mom they are flattering without being ridiculously tight they did shrink a little but i was prepared for that i m just under 5 5 and about 120 lbs ordered a size 9 the waist is a little big so i wear a belt my favorite jeans the black are baggier then the dark blue denim in fit though these are good jeans but i had to cut them to get them over my feet who ever made these needs to realize you cant put skinny jeans on if the hole is too small for your foot to get through love the jeans and how they feel nwe buy these all the time and live the different colors available and the stretchy lines of the material nhowever really wish the sizing was more true to size im def a thick chick and 14 is my size i fit 12 14 in everything i wear buy except these i have to buy the 17 and they are the biggest size offered and they even they fit as a 14 but even the 17 is too little so thats the downsize i dont like i was in store one day and grabbed the black pair in my size 15 in nb love the way they hold my tummy in with no muffin top i m 5 6 and ankle length is perfect super excited about the fit and can t beat the price so i decided to get the dark wash in my same size 15 took them home and washed because of the odd smell from the dye decided to wear the dark wash ones today and they were too tight i did not dry them but that should not matter because they are the same size as the black pair now i can t return them because i don t have the tag ndon t understand how the sizing is way off i m actually kind of sad how these jeans fit they re fine when your stand but as soon as you sit there are sewed in lines for design purposes that cut into your thighs maybe size up because it will be a while before you can return them due to covid tried on at store to make sure it was the right size but i didn t have the fund to get them till now i order the size i tried on and when i got them the didn t fit at all they re really sized small i usually wear a 13 14 in all brands but i couldn t even pull up the 13 never mind button it lol walmart s great on returns though so no biggie i received these and it said hr and they weren t o couldn t even get them past my thighs i m normally a 12 and bout 13 not even close they were also low rise style and looked like they were returns pretty sure the pair that i received were defective i could barely get my foot through the foot hole and the pants were skin tight like 2 sizes too small im a size 7 nordered the same pants in black and those fit perfectly,women's clothing,0
434,Athletic Works Women's Plus Size Dri-More Bootcut Sweatpants,12.0,4.5,976.0,well made comfortable good value pants fit perfect fit perfect great fabric length perfet pants great work out pants great pants just not sure how long they will last nice pants if you are under 5 ft 8 inches comfy don t want to take them off hello cellulite wonderful feel just too short great for walks not for work danskin pants inconsistency in sizing very comfortable pants not really a bootcut pant these are fitted,comfortable well made pants they fit really well and i think true to size they wash really nicely i love these pants n nthere are two things that would make these pants amazing i wish they had a drawstring to cinch the waist a bit and i wish they had pockets these are the best yoga pant type pants i have ever owned they fit great they are long enough im 5ft 8in and most of these pants are high waters on me not these made well and super comfortable i bought a black pair loved them so much i ordered another black pair and a navy pair and im thinking of buying two more pair i love them these pants are more like yoga pants than sweatpants and the are so comfortable they fit perfectly i am 5 8 and it is hard to find yoga pants that are long enough and length on these is perfect even after i washed them i am buying two more pair these are my favorite workout pants better material and fit than 30 lane bryant and avenue yoga pants i ve owned i m 5 9 size 18 20 and have a tough time finding plus sized workout pants that are long enough these are perfect the material is thick enough that it doesn t accentuate cellulite but still quite fitted i wear tunic length tees with these and the bootcut shape is flattering and un frumpy they have a tiny pocket inside the waistband that looks like it would hold an mp3 player i ve been wearing these to the gym 2 3x a week for about six months now and they re starting to fade and fuzz a bit so i just ordered two more pairs i have danskin workout pants in capri length too but this version ankle length is more flattering the danskin tanks are also great i layer them under long t shirts to ensure that i don t accidentally flash anyone when i m working out i have purchased this pair of pants more times than i can remember i love them they are cool in the summer and warm in the winter they look great and wash like a dream they fit perfect and nfrankly i don t wear any of the other pants i have in my closet i m hooked on these for sure the colors black and navy stay true without any fading i don t like the grey because they just don t look as good i sure wish they came in more colors than just three i would love brown green olive and maybe a deep purple i would buy2 of each color for sure the price is amazing and a fantastic value i saw the same pair of pants at my local very expensive big girl shop for 49 99 no kidding you can not go wrong with these pants i got these on black friday 2 for 12 which is an awesome deal for any plus size clothing i like pants that are tighter on top which these pants are so when i m working out i don t have to worry about tying knots in the drawstrings which these dont have or constantly pulling them up while i m on the elliptical i am tall at almost 5 11 so they could stand to be an inch or 2 longer so that when i sit they don t become mini high waters but for what i use them for they re great and i m sure an average height woman they are meant for the material is stretchy so i ordered a little smaller to ensure i wouldn t be swimming in my work out pants i can wear 20 22 in jeans but for these i went 18 20 for the money i spent i m very happy these pants say boot cut on them but i couldn t see wearing these pants with any nice boots the material look it s meant to go with some tennis shoes even in the model picture so don t buy these for a formal occasion or work unless you work in a casual environment i would wear these in place of scrub bottoms actually they re really comfy these pants fit great they are comfortable and i like wearing them the material is not thin nor is it too thick i don t get too hot wearing them however the fabric at the crotch is beading up and wearing thin faster than i expected and some of the stitching doesn t appear top notch in short i don t expect these to last for years and years maybe just for a year which is ok considering the price there is a band around the waistband that does not stretch and is uncomfortable also the legs are super wide and not long enough i would appreciate a notation in the description of the inseam and circumference of the pant at the bottom where th foot is the fabric is nice very comfortable and lightweight they re too long for me but i knew that when i purchased them as i always look at inseam length i m hoping they shrunk length wise only haha in the dryer i wanted something like this for days where i need to run errands and don t feel like wearning jeans these are not sweatpants they re athletic workout pants i ordered these thinking they were sweatpants sweatpants have a fleece inside them there is no fleece and easier just stretchy and i have four pair that i really don t have any use for these are not something that s going to keep me warm and that s what i wanted you need to check out how you phrase what they are i have been looking for workout sweatpants but have been extremely frustrated in my search until i found these pants i wasn t sure which size to order because i can wear 3 different sizes depending on day and the manufacturer i ended up buying 2 different sizes the smaller size fit perfectly if i want a more fitted look the larger size was a little big but looked good enough to wear on those days when i want to feel extra comfortable the price was great and i am thinking about ordering some more in other colors the only problem i have with them is that i don t want to take them off they are soooo comfortable yet stylish that i can wear them with a sweatshirt and sneakers or put on a nice sweater and shoes and wear them to work i am a therapist that does home health i think they have now become my new uniform i was really disappointed in the material on these i ve bought danskin before from walmart that i just loved because they were flattering and made with really nice material these are not the same material and they really cling to every bulge and piece of cellulite i have so if you are thin they would be great but not for a chunky monkey like me i have looked for pants like this for years they are so comfortable and can go bummy with a t shirt and athletic shoes or a little more uptown with a turtleneck and casual shoes they wash well and wear well the plus size does not swallow you yet allows room and is somewhat flattering i bought 2x i am 5 3 195 pounds yes they are long but everything is long on me can be hemmed and thereby hide the small logo at the bottom making them even easier to dress up a bit the size was spot on although the length was a disappointment i m 5 7 and 250 pounds and the workout pants fit wonderfully around my waist and hips i m kinda fluffy lol but the length of the pants was just too short for they flash my ankles unless i lower the pants but then i gotta hike them up again if i m doing any bending or lifting so now these are my at home lounge pants still a win great material although after a couple washes they are starting to fade already as mentioned by others unless you re a 7 foot amazonian expect to have to get these hemmed the quality was very good for the price they re thick without being too heavy suitable for working out but not for the office imo contrary to what a few others suggested n none other note the legs are very wide from waist to hem they aren t really a bootcut comforable but be aware if you don t like clothing flapping around during zumba class i wish wal mart would carry these in the store they have in recent years but haven t seen them this year plus in store i have never seen these pants over the size 2x so as long as walmart com carries my 3x and is always available you will always have a returning customer 1st ordered a 2 pk pants in 2 one came as 18 the other 22 tho both tags also as 2 a re ordered in 2x as 22 fit perfect got a 18 and 20 even tho tag also says 2x fustrating to return gave to goodwill kept one or marked 22 as fit 3 pr given away won t be ordering any more the color runs a bit so i washed them alone in cold water the first two times dried in hot temp dryer to get the shrinking over with i use a motorized wheel chair and my pants shrink and ride up yuck but these pants wowed me with maintaining their shape and length also the boot cut is a bit wider than most but maintain their style even in a wheelchair i bought and navy and black but am planning on getting most of the other color good purchase i liked everything about these pants except that they were not really a bootcut they were more straight leg they were somewhat short too or would be too short after washing so i returned them i am 5 5 and i would have liked them to be a bit longer i couldn t decide between the bootcut and relaxed fit i ended up ordering the bootcut but was a little disappointed when i received them and the picture on the lable showed them as being fitted like a leggins or tight yoga pants with just a flair at the bottom my gut is a big problem area for me and these just really made my gut stick out i ended up reordering the relaxed fit and couldn t be happier these are great pants and i probably would have kept them and just worn a long shirt but with the option of ordering relaxed fit i decided to give those a try,women's clothing,0
435,Jordache Women's Mid Rise Skinny Jean,16.94,4.4,630.0,my new favorite love these jeans nice looking love these jeans hips and waist have the same measurement comfortable dark and medium wash have back pocket designs ok works as sleep bra only smelly jordache jeans my go to ordering 2 more pairs right now a size smaller nice jeans two flaws buy them now so far so good love these pants great fit better than ae jeans really good jeans never again,great fit and nice soft fabric i wear these all the time love the fit i am short and these have always fit me better then any other jeans these were my favorite when i was younger and in school so glad to be able to purchase them once again these are true to size for me i wear size 8 ordered 8 and they fit nicely they feel good and i like the price got a denim pair and black pair both look nice dressed up or just casual the black is especially nice looking with a nice top and cute shoes haven t washed either one yet cold water for sure and i usually hang dry my jeans so won t be able to say how they do in a dryer i haven t worn jordache jeans in over 30 years but i thought after reading reviews that i d give them a shot again i love these i like they are not too thin and the way they fit feels fabulous good quality i m 5 2 168 lbs this pants would fit better to a much taller woman with wider waist but they are cute soft and comfortable ordered normal size and they fit great only problem is the back pockets design shown in the picture was not what i received the back pockets have a design and not plain as shown i would order them again in a different color i was very excited about these because of the reviews they are great quality fits nice good stretch but beware that the dark and medium wash has back pocket designs i don t mind the design but based on the online photos they have blank back pockets with no embroidering i was a bit disappointed with that i wanted something plain and simple just ok fits well in waist but not at all a skinney jean legs are more like a straight cut with a lot more room than excepted otherwise fabric is nice and color nice washed well only rated 2 stars because it wasn t as described cup size is great no lining i missed that band size is big on my but true to size as i always measure a 34 but buy big because other brand run small zero support if you are petite like me even with the straps as tight as they can go it works over a regular bra or as a sleep bra only these pants smell like petroleum products and it does not wash out i smelled it but hoped a good wash would clear the dye smell i them put them on and my 3 yo called me out for being stinky so much for wearing those to the office lol jordache jeans have proven to be my go to brand the fit is exact to the sizing chart this is a new pair that i am adding to my worn out jordache jeans i love these jeans the comfort the color the quality and the price they are perfect i ordered a size 10 normal size and a size 12 thinking they might run small i tried the 10 first and it fit perfectly so i sent the 12 back but then i ended up ordering a size 8 because after having the size 10 on for an hour or so they stretched out and were too big i don t like my jeans painted on but i don t like them too baggy either i kept the 10 s i can wear them in a pinch but the size 8 is perfect a little snug right out of the wash but not too bad then they stretch and they re just right i m here right now ordering 2 more pair of size 8 s these jeans are very nice and they wear well however after being worn for a couple of hours they loosen up a little too much also when then arrived they had this horrible chemical smell after washing them three times they still have this smell would have given 5 stars if it wasn t for these two things the black pair is amazing for some reason the blue ones don t fit the same the length is perfect i am 5 8 and am 170 lbs i got the size 12 and they fit great not too tight where i m going to bust out and not too loose just right i love these pants they are the only pants i buy and wear so happy they are back at walmart cant find them anywhere but here they fit an look great if you are an apple you need these i have skinny legs small hips and tiny butt bu a waist as big or bigger than my hips these are what i have always looked for fit close to my legs and thighs a true super skinny but not painted on like leggings jeggings they fit close to my butt but fit my waist without the pinched in half feel or big muffin top of most n nthe stretch does not sag at the knees or butt either after wearing awhile i have had excellent luck with them i highly recommend these 169 lbs size 12 ni usually wear ae jeans that are easily twice the price i prefer these for several reasons they fit higher on the waist to help hide my love handles aka back fat i like that the front pockets are not real i m tired of having to check to see if my pockets are poofing out they also seem to fit my legs better so that the jeans don t pull down when i bend over ni do not put these jeans in the dryer i bought one pair of these in blue to see if i liked them i did they are a very nice shade of blue i ordered another pair along with the miseltoe red these fit great they are also high rise these isn t any bagging anywhere even in the legs i hope they get more colors in made out of this fabric i would love to see the hounds tooth back in gray and black i had a pair which i loved and wore all the time which wore them out missing back belt hoop also cheaper lightweight jeans material not heavy jean material i purchased in the store same price same description now i will shop exclusively at kohl s i ve shopped at kohl s online for 7 years and never had a problem with poor quality or seconds getting shipped to my house by mistake i tried walmart online this one time my mistake accidentally ordered a size up but they still fit with a belt this brand is a favorite of mine and im enjoying the quality,women's clothing,0
436,Athletic Works Women's Active Dri More Core Shelf-Bra Racerback Tank,6.5,4.6,391.0,love these built in bra tops happy with purchase satisfied customer excellent love this workout top so glad i bought two nice all around top for the price found it a bit snug so glad i found these comfortable great shirt live in this 38 ddd approved great tops i liked so much that i ordered 3 different colors comfy pandemic home wear perfect tank comfy my new favorite,i like tops with a built in bra but they are becoming increasingly difficult to find years ago i purchased some similar danskin tops and these are essentially identical i am 5 6 140 lbs with a 35 inch barely b bra size and the medium is perfect i have two of these in every color they are supportive and cover what needs to be covered can be worn to work out or as a casual tank top price is great five stars very comfortable athletic top plenty of support for low intensity sports like biking and walking haven t tried it for aerobics but might work fine i like the way it is longer than some other tops with bra shelf fits like picture not too snug and not loose i will wash in cold water and not dry it other tops not the brand have shrunk in the dryer runs full i have 2 other in different colors would have ordered an xs but they do not offer that size only small i loved it the right size enough support to use for exercise or around the house also good quality in material i have about 15 of these in black and i love them this year i am buying about 10 of these in navy blue i just got two of these i think they are fabulous i m about to use it for an at home workout this is a real life upgrade i have been using old nursing tanks which are 9 years old i ordered my usual walmart size small and the fit is perfect it seems like other reviewers my height and weight were going with a medium but that would have been way too big this top will not work for any high impact not enough support but will be great for pilates yoga etc i am 5 8 140lbs 34d slender athletic build if that helps anyone with sizing i bought these to go with my pj bottoms love it perfect for what i needed and great price none reviewer mentioned there is not a lot of stretch to the fabric so if you plan on using for work out gear i can see more difficulty disrobing off a sweaty body i didn t see any construction issue as reported by someone else i small build busted and ordered 3 colors in size s ordered this because i needed to update my workout gear and i loved the former renditions of this item unable to find one exactly like the original i settled for this one and it definitely worked out fits firmly against the body and is great for workouts the dri more technology really helps in not drenching in sweat after a hard workout get you some it could fit a bit looser for a xxl otherwise i like it for lounging around the house and i just might use it as a swim top for at the beach since the built in bra feels just like a swim top linner they run really big mostly cotton so i washed one and dried on hot hardly any shrinkage if it fit well i d love it but it s still comfortable will try to send other one back for smaller size i have been looking for tanks with a bra shelf to sleep in great fit nicer fabric than i expected could wear as a tank i purchased 4 navy black grey and white will wear white to sleep in not in public ordered all in xl as i m 5 9 size 10 38 dd this is a very comfortable top it was hard to find a cotton tank with built in bra and sturdy straps not those thin spaghetti straps the low price was an added bonus it s very comfortable to sleep in especially if you are large busted and need support while sleeping it washes very well it runs true to size i would actually love a long sleeve version of this for winter time i have been looking for more of these since the brand change and finally decided to try to order absolutely love them they are pretty much the same as the old brand and may even be slightly more comfortable i wear these almost daily and my mom has even bought them now live in this top holds my 42 ds up im a solid 18 20 and the xxl fits perfectly i m at home all the time now and just want to be comfortable and a teeny bit cute this is my third purchase of this item fits great i wear one daily instead of a bra for my remote work from home lifestyle i get support and coverage over the belly area no roll up like other tanks the shelf bra is all the support i need been searching for a top with racer back cotton with some lycra and a bra shelf liner these have worked well good quality are versatile and launder nicely good quality and very comfortable top i ordered the white and i liked so much that i ordered the black and navy blue the navy blue runs a little small i previously purchased the danskin now brand but they aren t available anymore these athletic works are the same i wear one of these most days instead of a bra i m a 38dd for the past few years as i work on the telephone from home in fl they are perfect for gardening home exercises and wearing under a big t shirt or an open button shirt when i need to go to the grocery or pharmacy i only buy the navy or black colors because my nipples show thru the other colors i wear two different sizes the xl is a loose fit this is one of my favorite sport shelf bra tank ever someone who needs lots of support on those delicate areas while going to the gym its a must this tank does the trick very comfortable true to size love that this can be find in different colors my favorites colors are the darker colors i have ordered the 1 blue 2 black and one white i totally recommend this tank its hard to find it at the stores but if you find them online get them my new fave nsize chart runs a little larger than expected i purchased one med and one lg i will exchange the larger one,women's clothing,1
437,"Hanes Women's Cotton Hi-Cut Panties, 6-Pack",19.31,4.0,2668.0,always a good purchase good underwear for homeless women snug inconsistant sizes don t expect to get the same size twice no happy the bad reviews are really true beware ladies small extremely irritating interior seams walmart is the awesome love my hanes cotton hi cut panties not nearly as comfortable as they used to be cut and sizing less quality each time quality unsatisfactory the best ouch something bit me,i love the panties nice colors and comfy but with my new shape after all the old age and complete hysterectomy they do roll down when i am sitting i wish i still have hips as they would be perfect nso not buy them if you have no hips any more but they will be wonderful if you still have them soft and comfortable run slightly small but if you usually buy a certain size should be okay to stick with that size if you don t mind them a tiny bit snug we buy hanes cotton underwear in bulk and provide it to homeless women in our community through our program lifted spirits we provide respite for women off the streets for a few hours a new pair of underwear helps with hygiene and dignity felt a little snugger than the high cut white briefs especially in the leg openings not as comfortable as the high leg cut briefs good price for package of 8 but comes in different sizes two of them comes one size larger waist is 1 1 2 inches wider and crotch longer and loose others are true to size recommend if looking for good value i bought this item twice in the last 2 years the first pack loved them i needed something high enough to go over a c section incision the second pack terrible while they re the exact same size and style only 1 out of the pack of 6 are the same size as the previous pairs quality control is terrible the other 5 pairs were at least an inch to an inch and a half shorter in the front and much smaller overall and the tops roll down really disappointed because they were exactly what i needed the first time around waist band ripped 3 places first day i wore them i m not sure where hanes has moved all of their manufacturing but i know it isn t anywhere in the us n i read all the reviews and since i ve been a true customer for over 50 years i didn t believe them i was so wrong ladies nothing is the same the sizes are so off i gave my 13 year old granddaughter these i haven t had to buy more for about 7 years so i didn t know the quality of their fabric is terrible i can picture kids in a huge warehouse making very little money for sewing these together i can t understand why hanes can t move back to the us we have to look at the share holders as crooks in this case the owners also fall right in there with them it s not about profits when you get this greedy now it s about loss of business i ll warn everyone i know by all means available to me and i urge everyone scorned to do the same it won t change without us banding together these were very very small unusable for me the interior seams in the bottom of the pants are extremely irritating as they are raw unfinished edges i can t wear them i love these panties so very comfortable don t bunch up in places you don t want them to wear very good also had to get refund because they sent the wrong product i gave them to a shelter for someone to get some use out of them i am re ordering very pleased to see the cut of this style and the fit is as expected after some of the reviews made me hesitant however they fit perfectly the hi cut is my favorite and other than the waistband being a bit narrower i m very happy with my hanes panties something s changed in the quality and construction of these underwear i ve purchased these for years my absolute favorite in the comfy cotton category but i m going to start trying other brands now it s the elastic it s awful it s cuts into me it s not soft anymore on the inside i ve compared it to the older ones and sure enough it s thinner not as stretchy and not nearly as comfortable against your skin they re cutting corners now and it s a shame because they re cutting customers too i have purchased this brand style and size before but these were different the elastic waist was narrower and the overall size is about 3 inches smaller i am very disappointed i ve been purchasing the same style and size for year because i love the 100 cotton the durability and the price and availability of the multipacks this set and the last seem to be cut differently and the prints that come with the assorted don t fit at all it s very disappointing these are a hanes product i gave worn for many many years with each order the briefs get smaller i just opened a package i forgot i had even since my last order of briefs the underwear was full cut and next to the ones i ve been wearing recently and the ones i just purchased was made of much more fabric in the past i ve brought bother changes in these garments to the attention of hanes but believe profitability probably supersedes quality today s briefs are of much less substance than than the original ones i bought over 15 years ago i may need to find another source i bought this once before and the texture was soft and cotton these say cotton but feel like polyester maybe i need to break them in i ve always worn hanes briefs but it appears t he material that is used is of a cheaper stock not happy at all i had to purchase undergarments from another retailer i am old school and still like a regular cotton panty that comes to the waist i had to order a package as local stores never have my size or style have stuck with hanes for years concerned about wear of these undies over time because the back panel rises up and the stitching is balled up on sides of them so that thread digs slightly against skin if one cuts excess thread risk putting a hole in the undies i had to use a bandaid for padding the balled up threat to avoid discomfort otherwise nice bargain for price,women's clothing,0
438,"Avia Women's Seamless Keyhole Sports Bra, Style AV18198",9.98,4.1,286.0,love great bra size way up but a great bra at a great price amazing bra so comfy i bought 3 great buy wont regret it size up at least two sizes great quality runs at least one size to small maybe 2 medium should be xs awesome and comfy best sports bra for me love this cute and great support same size does not fit the same not very comfortable pretty but cut for a child,what a great price for the quality and support has removable pads there is really no need to pay more on other brands i have 3 of these bras definitely a gym essential super comfortable and supportive you can t beat this price this bra is super cute and really comfortable i love the adjustable straps and the fit is perfect great for walking yoga or other lower intensity workouts or every day wear 36 a b xl n ni looked on her forever i didn t want a ton of padding but also nothing that created a weird breast shape oh and i didnt want to pay much lol this bra is a great fit and a great price not too much padding but just a little however you have to got to size way up i m a 36 a b bra and i had to get an xl it fits perfectly i dont think you can size up enough if you are a more average sized woman this is my second time buying this bra they made a few improvements from last summer and it was already a great bra im a size 16 and around 38d and i got the xxl fits great and i cant believe the price my other one has been worn and washed about 100 times and still has some life but i wanted to treat myself to a new one these bras last seriously high quality i bought this for yoga and it is perfect but since i find myself wearing it every day im here to buy more it provides nice support but not good for running its extremely comfortable i wear a m top size 36c bra and the l fits great if youre between sizes go up for me these fit better than the zip fronts yes it s true for me had to size up from a l xl to the xxl d cup but i maybe wouldn t purchase if my girls were larger the cups become unsituated when you wash but for the price they re easy to resituate and i do it happily the back is very stylish overall i feel great wearing this let me say that this sports bra has changed my life actually it really has i have seriously gained like 15 pounds i had a baby in 2016 then i was just like whatever the shelter in place started and here we are 30 pounds later trying to buy workout clothes on a budget these do not dissapoint i am a 36b c and got a large because well im on the large size right about now they wash good but should probably not go in dryer as thin pads protection moved does have holes for adjusting worked great on my run i could order for pick up so decided to check the other walmart on the other side of town and found punk and dark gray in large bought both and excited to start this journey and not spend ao much money i am a 38b 150lbs 5 7 and xl in this fits me perfectly size up two sizes as these run small great quality i agree with the comments about this being a bit snug i sized up one let s just say there wasn t an option to size up more and leave it at that it fits snugly but you want a bit of that to keep the girls in place and it does just that npersonally i don t know that i d run with it but i m shall we say blessed in that area so i need to strap em down i bought this for quarantining working from home i didn t want to get stabbed by an underwire unnecessarily but also didn t want to descend into full pajama mode this bra was a comfortable way to keep things where they belong without cutting off circulation and without stabbing me all day nthe price was right too and i m very happy with my purchase had previously bought this bra for my daughter about a month or so ago she absolutely loves it i decided to order more online for her they came today and the difference is not even comparable bottom is one bought in store top is what came today these are far most the worst sports bra i ve ever purchased pads move all over the place it is virtually impossible to keep them in one position they re hard to get over your head they are extremely too tight around your rib cage even if you go up a size or just one of those bras that is just too uncomfortable and no i would not recommend this to anyone if you have a chest larger than the usual jr high student do not order less than a large i received my package and the first thing i seen said low support the size chart for me 36dd called for a medium so that s what i got i m not going to waste time returning the product just going to give it to my daughter in seventh grade super comfy and really great for what i do for work 8 to 10hrs 4 days a week of delivering packages in heat and doesn t smell bad at the end of the day everyday is still holding up like new when i pull it from the wash i hang dry and it keeps a good smell i m a 36 c and the xl fits me perfectly i bought 3 because that s all they had in my size i m ordering a few more this is the most comfortable sports bra it s thick soft and supportive well worth more than it costs i love this sports bra i just had a double mastectomy these are the most amazing sports bras ever i have in every color now more supportive than other more expensive brand and these look super cool now that i ve lost 42 pounds i wear the bras with my leggings and shorts i have d cups and this baby kept me from bouncing on the treadmill don t spend your money on the expensive sports bras sold elsewhere you will love this bra and so will your girls the first one i bought was at the store size l and i liked how it fit me i ordered 3 more of the same style and size online and thais came a lot more smaller that i cant even bare to have it on at all unfortunately i had already removed the tags and washed them before use so i cant return them very disappointed with these the fabric is not as stretchy and soft as i like it has enough support for my needs but its more stiff heavy fabric and not so easy to remove the reviews about the removeable pads are correct they have to be removed before washing washed separately and reinserted i had no problem with the feel of the metal pieces for adjusting as some reported it may just be the way it falls i would not purchase this item again but will wear it when i have no other sports bras in my clean pile runs so small that i couldn t even get it on the small which is my size for the last 60 years is so small a child could wear it,women's clothing,0
439,Dagacci Medical Uniform Unisex Scrubs Set Scrub Top and Pants,16.99,4.1,268.0,best scrubs for the money well made true fit i love these scrubs great product highly recommend great color and fit i love it well made but women should order smaller sizes scrubs flip flops sizing way off too small comfortable bigger than it states love them,bought them for my daughter for for mother s day i was a little apprehensive because i ve heard not good reviews about scrubs being sold at walmart but i was surprised and loved the material and how soft it was and how well they were made and my daughter loves them as well i have been a nurse for 15 years i must say this is one of the best scrub brands i ve tried they are stitched well the fabric is not see through the waist has give and the pants seems to have tad of a stretch to them the top is a bit roomier than i d expect but due to the way it s cut it still looks and fits well the price point is unbelievable for the quality also i received my order 4 days early if you are in need of scrubs you won t be disappointed i ordered 4 pairs because i needed them desperately and didn t have a ton of money to spend i am really surprised that the quality is so nice for such a low price i love the colors and the fit is pretty good i ordered a m after reading everyone s comments saying to order a size down they fit well a little snug but i think a l would be too boxy for my taste for reference i am about 5 3 and 170 lbs typically wear a size 10 12 in jeans if you are around my pants size and also curvy you may want to order a size up because they are not loose in any way haha i definitely cannot put them in the dryer but i do really like them scrubs are very comfortable good material and when washed in the washer machine it didn t loose the materials quality i enjoy the fact of the many pockets it has i love the product so much i bought 17 colors out of the 20 colors they have recommended to my co workers and they love the product as well after being home for 7 months i was starting a new job on 11 2 20 i had to have the purple scrub for orientation i went to my local uniform shop and learned i was a lot bigger than i thought i had gone from a medium to an xl i m 5ft 3 174lbs i found 2 that could fit realized they couldnt help me any further i tried walmart com and came across this set i bought size large the pants fit very well i love the elastic waist it also has a drawstring the shirt runs a little large but who cares for nyc winter you need room for thermals i will buy more of this brand and do recommend it this tv antenna is amazing i am enjoying using it and with this antenna i can stream and watch other channels like cnn at anytime it is easy to fix and use but make sure you use the manual that comes with it hurry to get yours before they get out it fits me well and very comfortable i would be recommending this to my friends and i am ordering very soon oh i almost forget people complimented me because of the color i love this color the garments are well made with good stitching the color i ordered was a vivid beautiful purple better than i expected the fabric feels very nice to touch i m giving it 4 stars because of the sizing which i found was not accurate at least for women s sizes fit i believe that the stated size and fit is perfect for men rather than women i did use the sizing chart but it was way too large for me it s a pity because the quality of the fabric and finish is very good i like my scrubs and the flip flops i ordered n i thought i order scrubs in petite the size was right but i always buy scrubs in petite i am short i paid someone to cut about 6 inches of the length not to happy about that other than that scrubs were good wish you would of had the hunter green not sure i want to order again though if i have to pay someone to cut the length then again if you sent them to long next time you would probably would send to short but thank you i do like my scrubs the flip flops are not like the ones i buy when i go walmart on the picture they looked like the ones i buy but i still like them thank you runs extremely big ni wear 2x 3x and ordered a 2xl because i wanted a tighter fit nthe color was great but these look like a 4x 5x a pack of wasted material nand i purchased 3 sets well i have some extra material to make some masks that s a plus i guess pants fit okay but shirt is way too big like 2 3 sizes off also material is kind of thick starchy which means it has no give makes you kinda hot and makes noises when you walk move definitely not as comfy as hospital scrubs like all the pockets though i ordered these because of the price for the complete set i got it at a decent time but i was soooo disappointed as it stated it was unisex and unless you are more shaped like a man this will not fit i ordered a 2x because every review said size up the material a bit stiff with aboslutely no stretch and the pants though length was great im taller then the average woman the inner thigh and hips part was sooo tight one step and it will probably rip the top was nice but if you have boobs will be tight arms a bit tight as well too much of a hassle for me to return so i might give it away smh i guess you need to size up 2 times in case you wash and it shrinks other reviews said these were a size bigger so i ordered one size smaller they were definitely too small had to return them comfortable scrubs my only complaint is that the pants are to short not designed for anyone over5 8 this runs big and the material is very silk like ti got a large and the top felt like i ordered 2x too big love these i read everyone else s reviews and did what they said i ordered a size down i was a little worried i am usually a large in tops and a medium in bottoms i ordered a medium set and both the top and bottoms fit perfectly the quality is good but the fit was not what i expected also the length of bottoms otherwise i would ve gave it a 5 very comfy the fit is more woman than unisex usually when i get unisex it s very baggy it has a nice fit i love it they are nice but the sizes run extremely small i bought a 2x which feels like a large be careful of your sizing i dislike that they are awkwardly cut it s a flare instead of straight leg this is one wrong set out of all the sets i have seven,women's clothing,0
440,"Women's Seamless Wire Free Lift Bra, Style FT640",24.1,4.2,499.0,good for lumpectomy not good for dropped boobs comfortable and soft not the best not the worst sized run larger than they should be boobs are not cone shaped they stink nice wire free bra option good bra for home out look at the picture love this bra real good low price nice size availability b cups too big comfort plus terrible bra nothing comparable for fit lift comfort price,ordered for sisters one who has had lumpectomy breast surgery loves this for non irritation and rounding out smaller uneven breast as well as supporting the other normal one the other sister who has dropped saggy baggy girls said there is not enough support to lift them back up where they belong it s very comfortable and supportive i m a rural mail carrier with asthma so finding a bra that isn t suffocating is difficult so i was quite surprised at how this bra fit for how low of a price it is at it s very comfortable and supportive i m a rural mail carrier with asthma so finding a bra that isn t suffocating is difficult so i was quite surprised at how this bra fit for how low of a price it is at i bought this bra for my teenage daughter and she loves it she is very athletic and finds the bra very comfortable to wear for long periods of time the bra is so soft and supportive i just had to buy it again for her this is one of the most comfortable bras i have purchased it doesn t have a wire which makes it so comfortable while giving a nice lift i have purchased several of these bras i would recommend them to anyone that needs support but also needs comfort i didnt realize how much padding it would have its soft but the padding on the cups feels like a sponge so when it bends it kinda keeps the line where it bends there not too fond of that runs a bit big so its comfortable i dont think its work the money though would not repurchase unless it was a bit cheaper ive seen better for the price at ross lol the bra is ok but it s small than others ni m 34 c and it s to tide so i needed return nyou need to buy order one size more ex for 34c order 36b or 36c it would have been perfect except it runs larger than it should have instead of getting just a 42c it is a 42c 40d cup size was just to big had to resell them at a loss because they were non returnable poor fit women s breasts are not triangular cones jutting out in opposite directions outside of cartoons makes me wonder if the designer has ever even looked at a set before the smell of the foam it stinks i washed them every day for a week and they still stink i tried waring one had it on for a hour and it made me sick to my stomach i want to sent them back but i washed all 7 of them i can t give them away because they stink this is a great wire free bra option fits pretty well and is comfortable to wear all day at work i m happy with this purchase and plan to get a couple more i m pretty busty and don t have a problem with too little support in this bra like most comfy bralette options that i try she is a 44b in all the plus size stores and 3x on tops this bra has a light push up support u this kind it is mesh but paded all through out stretchy great support strap can be fixed from front not back like all others it has 3 hinges for extra needed support they are tru to the picture so think if you would like your straps to hit just at that point nice fabric true to fit what i m not happy with is that it seems the straps are set wider for me they cut into the flesh right where my armpit starts also i do have trouble keeping them up i did tighten them that helps i may clip and stitch them a bit closer together in the back the bottom band is very comfortable doesn t bind nor twist under i love these bras i have now purchased 6 of them they just fit well and feel great at first i bought them in the store then i couldn t find them but looked up the code and here they were online i am so pleased this is a great bra for the cost i wear a 44b which is very hard to find the bra is not too tight and supportive only problem i have with it is my cups have a dent that doesn t look too good of course that could be my boobs i ordered this in a b cup and honestly i think a d cup person could fit in it without any spillage i know this is a design issue with fruit of the loom and nothing to do with walmart i don t think some lingerie companies have any idea of what the cup sizes mean in relation to women s bodies forget all of those expensive bras that claim to be so comfortable this inexpensive nfruit of the loom seamless wire free lift bra is the most comfortable bra on the planet bar none one thing you should know and that is that the cup size runs large and you should order the same size band but one cup size down for example i wear a 36 c but order a 36 b for a perfect fit this bra looked terrible it was so bad i didn t even open the plastic wrapping around it don t waste your money or tine the the lift and support is good but the fabric around the cups cracks just by wearing for few hours i bought 4 bras and each one of them have this problem the most comfortable bra on the planet with great lift they run large so buy one cup size smaller and it will fit perfect i wear a size 36c and ordered 36b they re so great i bought 10 of them,women's clothing,0
441,Avia Women's Seamless Zipfront Sports Bra,12.98,3.9,381.0,just ordered my 4th and 5th bra good everyday bra awesome bra good for after breast augmentation great bra great price comfort when needed comfort and support runs small avia zipfront zipper splits super small easy on easier off size up x3 comfortably keeps the girls in place great design idea but not worth it no more extra workout just to take off momof4 i live in these bras military style great sports bra,omg these are the most supportive bras i ve ever bought and i m almost 50 years old with 20 year old breast implants i absolutely love these bras my implants are still looking good and doing great excuse my bathroom remodeling but i noticed as i get older they definitely feel a little heavier than they used to well these bras take all of that away i feel like i can do jumping jacks in these i ve got different colors and i think i m about to order a few more don t want to take the chance on them not making these anymore so i better stock up good support for workouts not sure there is enough support for running but great for everyday sized well like the design has a hook and eye closure inside the zipper zipper seems to stay up so far definitely not high end materials we shall see how it holds up i would buy again at this price point this bra is amazing actually keeps everything where it should be while chasing my very active toddler zipper is handy for nursing without having any squeaky clasps i can actually go about my day and not have to worry about adjusting my bra a million times a day zipper stays put super soft used the size chart definitely true to size definitely recommend they didn t have this style in the store i had already bought a different style so i knew they would fit cute style just remember not to out themninnthe dryer or the zipper will break i love i had to size down originally had got and xl went to a l but i think thats because i just got a breast augmentation and i needed a tighter fit if you re looking for comfort then size up if you re getting these for surgery size down im a 36 but i get 38 for comfort in this case i had to get 36 and it fits perfect and surprisingly comfy they were wrong size so bought a bigger size with more choices but highly recommend especially after healing from breast reconstruction after cancer journey i have less pain with this front zip bra highly recommend great post op front zip sports bra at a great price bought bigger than normal for comfort have others for exercise when allowed this is a comfortable and supportive sports bra i buy front zip bras for working out because i can no longer get pull over bras off when they re damp from perspiration the avia zipfront bra was the answer it is well made i gave it a 4 star rating because they run super small ordinarily i buy a small or medium sports bra in this case i had to buy a large and it is not roomy i really like this bra for the price and comfort just buy a size up fits a bit snug i bought a large i normally wear a medium but wanted a little more room i am glad i bought the large the front zipper is a bit cheap i am scared it is going to break i squeeze my chest together to zip after using the inner hook do not buy these i am a medium but did not want the bra to be so tight so i bought a large they are comfortable but have nothing but trouble with the zipper splitting at the bottom i thought the loop and hook closure would prevent it but not so i have worn them only a few times but i am throwing them away this is ridiculous won t buy another avia sizes are way to small compared to sizing chart i was disappointed after waiting weeks for it to arrive and it didn t fit i like it because i can easily get it off when i am wet from sweat i am not sure if it is high impact support i like these i ordered several in different colors my complaints are 1 they are hella small and 2 the zipper cover at the bottom of the bra shows through my shirts and looks weird especially to guys that dont know these bras exist lol n nas for the size im 125 pounds size 34 a b i bought a large and it fits comfortably would not recommend if you are larger chested these would suffocate your boobs lol this sports bra comfortably keeps the girls in place there is a front hook in the front under the front zipper that makes zipping so easy the zipper fold under the bottom material flap making for a smooth wear it also has a removable and adjustable padded insert which is nice this bra is very comfortable and provides good support so once u get it on its very comfy but getting it on wasnt very easy the zipper wasnt catching the track and was a pain to zip and also unzipped once on a few times also the padding in the cups move around quite a bit wouldnt recommend or purchase again i love these front zip sports bras have 4 in different colors no more struggling to take off when you re sweaty like with over the head sports bras good support i am not a fan of bra shopping but this sports bra is great i am a 36 dd and it fits perfectly it has a hook on the inside before you zip it and it is much more supportive feels comfortable all day washes very well holds it shape definitely recommend after double mastectomy and reconstruction this is the only bra i wear i recommend them to ladies like me the band is not super tight and it allows a firm but not tight hold on the girls this bra has helped to reduce the swelling under my arms i will never buy those pricey ones i m a stay at home at the moment so sports bras are all i wear it s kind of hard to keep looking good attractive for my husband and the zipper bra can both be comfortable and make you attractive by unzipping a little and i m crazy for camo so of course i wanted it it s comfortable attractive and camo what more do you need so comfy and great quality for the price the only issue i had was fi ding my size every darn walmart i go to it s like a treasure hunt to find my correct sizws for anything in the store it s stupid and frustrating but this sports bra is co fy and nice just order online and pray that your size is in stock also use the walmart app in store so you do t looks like a scavenger just trying desperately to find your correct size lol sad but true,women's clothing,0

443,"Women's Essential V-Neck T-Shirt, 2 Pack Bundle",9.88,4.4,375.0,great set of tees very nice dress t shirt nice shirts cute casual tee great quality highly recommend fantastic great fit summer must nice quality nice price great value for the price and true to size would recommend great value for the price soft fabric and fitted style purchase in the men s department comfortable and versatile med lightweight t shirt comfortable tops great around the house tees,i love time time and tru they have upped their fashion in the last year or so these tees are great love the v neck i reviewed them on my instagram feed 417bargainfindergirl and they were a hit this is a very nice material for a t shirt it kinda has a spandex feel to it almost like water would run off it but also cotton like at the same time very comfortable and dressy you can wear this under and blazer or vest for a dressed up look i like these very much these would be great to play tennis in or any excercise regimen i would recommend these for all of the above ways to wear them and feel casual comfortable and dressed up all at the same time the black is a really nice black and i don t think this type of material will fade because of the polyester nice shirt you get 2 in a pack i really like these shirts they are soft on the skin and breathable the material is durable and has a little stretch to it i will definitely recommend these shirts great quality huge fan of these especially the white length is not too short i am 5 9 and they wash up well wish i could get more nice quality cute t shirts the green is a little lighter than in the picture but still great color this is not a stretchy form fitting tshirt my daily go to for working around the house running to the store dressing for the average work day these wash well keep their shape color stays bright sleeves are comfy not tight blouse fit is great for large chest cut is just high enough not to show cleavage these are fantastic basic tees for any wardrobe true to size with a nice fitted feminine shape that looks so much better than boxy tees the fabric is light and silky i ordered the blue cove two set and it s a nice deep navy color overall very pleased these are a must for lounge casual wear i m a true medium size but purchase them in l for a comfy in house wear i d say they are true to size on the roomy side bust and upper arms they washed well but i think they ll survive one season heavy wear the women s essential short sleeve v neck t shirt comes 2 in a package the first thing you notice is the stretchiness of the fabric the time and tru is printed in white on the inside of the back of the t shirt made of 60 cotton and 40 polyester a nice combination delivering quality from the cotton content and comfort from the polyester addition allowing for good fabric stretch it is a size l or 12 14 however i am a size 0 2 4 depending on brand and this large size t shirt fits me big as i like it but not too big this is to say the size is a bit smaller than other items with the designation of a large size i think the large is more like a medium and this is the only reason i rated it 4 star and not the full 5 star nevertheless i would highly recommend purchase of this t shirt because it is a comfortable wear the medium size i ordered fit like a large and did not shrink when they were washed so the t shirt was a little big on me the material is thin and not soft it doesn t look nice enough to be worn out and it s not comfortable enough to lounge in i ll be returning these i took one star off because of the fabric itsi took one star off because of the fabric its not as soft as i would like its me but then again its only five dollars so it really is a good value for the money i will say if you want to be a little bit loose for lounging in the house i would size up otherwise it fits true to size nice soft basic white tees to wear with a flannel or sweater or wear by itself they fit well and are very comfortable i also love how it comes with two great price love the tee shirts and love the baby powder scent of the johnson baby oil want to order more but been unable to find 20 ounce size bottle to reorder great little t for everyday best value for the price haven t washed them yet hope they hold up ni m 5 2 133 lbs size 34 b i got the size m they fit great these are ok a bit thin but not see through the fabric is soft and hasn t pulled they are a fitted style i would order size up if you don t want it to be tight very small and tight i wear a 2x and it didn t cover my stomach i buy the same kind of shirt from the men s department and it fits i don t like the colors they have but at least it covers my whole top half this t shirt is medium to lightweight not super thin but not heavy the material is soft and it is tag less so it is very comfortable the cut of the shirt is slightly flared at the bottom so it does make it bit more stylish than a typical t shirt it looks nice with jeans but also could be worn with a casual skirt or slacks washing instructions are cold water and tumble dry low after washing one a couple times i did not see any obvious shrinking or fading compared to its unwashed twin from this 2 pack black size l even though i dried it on medium heat against the instructions also no pills fuzzies seem to be forming i ve had thin t shirts that got the fuzzies after only one washing so these t shirts seem like they will have more longevity overall a comfortable versatile t shirt i have a few of these and this a great brand of short sleeve tops they go with just about anything i wear them with jeans shorts and shirts basic black is essentially what should always be in a wardrobe the cut for the length and the v neck perfect the material is breathable and keeps it shape this 2 pk bundle arrived both in color black but once again you never can go wrong black t s make an outfit i purchased the pack of two black tees really just to wear around the house to do chores and maybe sleep in i have done both and i m pleased my one complaint is they are a little more form fitting than i would ve liked but i still find them comfortable and was happy with the price,women's clothing,1
444,Time and Tru Zipper Bootie (Women's) (Wide Width Available),12.0,4.4,230.0,perfect fall boots w time and tru zipper bootie cute bootie wide width comfortable loved the first pair so i ordered a second pair great for work or for dressing up jeans love these booties and i can t believe they fit cute great quality for a small price bootie women s shoes buy a half size up stylish and classy w tt zipper bootie ww black 6 5 wide nice shoes cute booties sooo comfortable love these perfect boot for any occasion nice zipper bootie great fit and style,these are the perfect fall boots i wear a 6 5 normally so that is the size i chose the 6 5 fit but a little snug not too snug to where i can t wear them though and i bet as i wear them even more they will loosen up some the color is the perfect olive color pair them with some skinny jeans a wine red shirt and black cardigan and you got the perfect fall look the heel is the perfect height and isn t too big the zipper on the side has cute tassels that hang off for the price these boots are very well made and look great the wonder time tru zipper bootie s wide width is man made of leather looking material but is not leather the boots are very well stitch and has a one inch heel that is easy to walk in they also have memory foam inside which are very comfortable for you feet the zipper is very sturdy and easy to zip with the tassel when putting on or off boots the boots are have a cuff stitch on top front which gives a nice look these boots are ankle length and are causal to wear with a dress skirt shorts or pants the bottom sole of boots have ridges so not to slip to easily i look forward to wear my boots in comfort out this os a cute bootie with a nice size heel not too high therefore you can wear it for an extended period of time without your feet starting to ache which is a huge plus perfect for work church or a night out the part of the shoe that sits right on top of your foot is a little hard stiff which is expected from a brand new shoe but after some wear it will loosen up just have to break it in even with that i would still recommend this shoe comfortable cushion bottom nice to have wide width available for those of us with a wider foot cute tassel on the zipper i love a good boot that hits at the right spot and doesn t have a super tall heel these have the perfect heel height not too tall and the top hits perfectly right at the ankle can t wait for the fall season highly recommend i received a free pair of time and tru zipper bootie brown to try out review and keep on behalf of the walmart spark program because i love absolutely everything about them i immediately ordered the same pair but in black i live in jeans and boots throughout fall winter and early spring that means i need boots that fit and feel great on my feet and hold up well as they ll be worn 6 months straight i m not a fan of high heeled anything lol these boots have a nice roughly 2 inch heel to them perfect for me the design is pretty simple and basic nothing super fancy i like this as well each bootie has a zipper on the outer part of the boot which is easy to zip and unzip without issue because i have wide feet and high arches i did order the wide width boots i highly recommend you do the same if you have similar feet issues for me the best part about time and tru is the fabulous memory foam insoles not only do they provide wonderful support for my feet they feel fantastic the booties are very well made also precise and strong stitching no scuffs or marks of any kind the day my brown booties arrived i wore them around the house to test them for my review my feet felt wonderful they were comfortable the entire time i had the boots on i did wear them for a significant amount of time my feet did not become sore tired or achy at all i knew these were the boots for me and immediately ordered a pair in black as well and the price of these gems can t be beat if you re in need of some very comfortable booties that look awesome with jeans or dress pants you re going to want to give time and tru a try your feet will not only look great they ll feel great too if you re looking for a pair of basic booties that will go with almost anything but still have a flair for on point fashion these shoes are a great fit for you the zipper on the outside of the shoe rather than the more typical zipper near the inside ankle helps the look of these booties to stand out from the crowd having the zipper on the opposite side of the shoe may play tricks with your muscle memory when you first put the shoe on so they re not quite slip on and go but it s well worth the trade off these booties are comfortable but they do run a bit narrow overall these are a great addition to my wardrobe my feet are about a size 7 1 2 but my lower body is paralyzed making it difficult to get certain styles of shoes on my feet so i generally have to order a size 8 i have trouble especially with boots of any kind so when i ordered these booties in size 7 i fully expected that i wouldn t be able to wear them and i d have to give them to my daughter which would have been fine as she likes them too still out of an undying hope i might finally find a bootie i can wear i tried them on as soon as they arrived holy moly they fit and beautifully too so then i took a really good look at them they are really nice boots with a zipper on the side note the zipper is on the outside of this boot rather than the inside the stitching is good the color is matte the insole is made of memory foam and the soles are non skid the zipper slides up and down smoothly enough and has a short leather pull to help these booties will go with so many looks but i will be wearing them with leggings and a tunic as my autumnal uniform i guess it s the wide fit that makes it possible for me to get my feet into these booties but i suspect they might run a bit large anyway so order with that in mind overall i am really impressed with the quality and look of these booties if i could change one thing it might be that i d prefer the zipper to be on the inside as in the inner ankle part so as to leave a smoother look on the more visible part of the boot but the zipper looks good too so that is a very minor thing i really love these booties and i can t wait to start wearing them all the time this fall overall i like the boots they will be a nice addition to my fall and winter wardrobe it s currently summer and i could not wear these all day this review is based on wearing the boots for about 30 minutes at a time wow walking around my home minus one star because the shoe lacks an appropriate cushioned insert in my opinion the boots are stylish i always purchase boots one size larger these boots are in 11 wide and they fit my foot perfectly may have issues when i attempt to wear these with thicker socks but i have not tried it yet i think these boots are a solid bet for occasional wear in the upcoming season the color is a nice cognac brown these shoes are made well when i first got them the first thing that stood out to me was it s weight these are not made from the consistent cheap material that you see most shoes being made from now a days it looks sleek i love that the shoe was very spacious as soon as my daughter saw the shoes she said i want them she s 17 years old i thought these were like 30 40 but they left the price tag on them and boy was i shocked for less than 15 this is for sure a steal i m a huge walmart shopper i ve not seen this quality for this price at all these booties are pretty cute i ordered a 8w and sometimes it just depends on the shoe if it will fit right or not i also tried it without socks on so that could have played a part in this but the shoes were a bit big on me nothing terrible they were comfortable i like the way they feel the leather is soft i love the zipper side that adds the bit of flare they were missing i d like to try these with a pair of jeans on to see how they look i m not a huge fan of pointed toe shoes and they re not exactly pointed in my opinion more pointed rounded but still i would ve preferred more round tip they are cute though overall if they had a gray suede version i would like them a lot more like i said though they are comfortable when you walk they are not too high and i would give them an 8 out of 10 if i could i believe if you like booties then you will like these these are super cute zipper half boots in a lovely taupe color i usually wear a seven and a half and sometimes an eight i got theses online in a seven and a half but would probably prefer them a half size larger to an eight unfortunately i do not see them in the store so i am not sure that i will pursue exchanging the size the toe area comes too much to a point and squishes my toes uncomfortably i have yet to walk in them all day and only have briefly tried them on i tried them on with some lightweight socks as i would usually wear with half boots i was pleasantly surprised however to find that there was a pretty good support for my arch this has been a constant difficulty to find in any shoe and would seem to me to be a fantastic benefit of this half boot the boot zips on the outside of the leg which is fantastic and so the zippers will not bang against each other as you walk the zippers showcase a cute decorative tassel which can aid in pulling the zipper up and down the taupe color is great because of how it can basically match everything and anything there is a soft pho brushed leather material constructing the outside of the half boot with other shoes i have had with a similar material i find it can be scratched easily but with these boots i can run my fingernails across the surface and can see no scratch at all these half boots also come with a memory foam on the bottom which actually provides great comfort i have found that time and true products are a fantastic quality and are among my favorite pieces to wear i loved these boots they look good after wearing and great for autumn and winter wear i felt they were a little stiff on the first wear but slowly have been becoming more comfortable with use the zipper looks good quality and will last long this is a pair of w tt zipper bootie ww black 6 5 wide they are ankle high boots with a side zipper the insole is made of memory foam making these boots very comfortable to wear they have a sleek design that can be worn with any outfit these w tt zipper bootie ww black 6 5 wide are a great addition to any wardrobe these shoes are pretty nice i love the look they are very trendy i can also appreciate how low to the ground they are that will help to make them much more comfortable to walk in even though they are low heeled they still look very nice and fashionable i can tell they are not leather though they have more of the cheaper look but they re still nice nonetheless i really like the line of the shoe around the ankle it s not a straight line so it adds to the design making it look even nicer the inside of the shoe says memory foam so that s always a plus it helps to have comfortable shoes as there were no sharp or rough edges squeezing my feet overall these are pretty nice shoes and i would recommend i received the time and true zipper booties they are so cute i got a wide width as i have wide feet and they are so comfortable they have the memory foam soals my foot does not slide in them and i can wear them all day with no problems i love the deep rich brown color they have the zippers on the outside of the bootie they have a good amount of tread for safety they run true to size i can t wait until fall they will go with so many outfits the time and true zipper booties are a quality item i like the time and true brand you get quality at a good price i really like them and i can t wait to wear them i highly recommend these booties i normally order an 8 1 2 in boots but they didn t have that size so i ordered a 9 i have wide feet and was a little hesitant they came in i put them on and they re perfect i have worn them all day with no pain i still have some room so if i want to wear thick socks but they don t fall off when i walk so that s a plus love the material and the heel is perfect nice stylish bootie that goes with almost everything i love the color of these brown boots and they are so comfortable they go well with any color jeans imo they run true to size and i needed to get the wide which is great for my foot the heel is the perfect height for walking around at work or out shopping they look nice the only thing i find odd is that the zipper is on the outer side of the boot rather than on the inside on all of my other boots the zippers touch when my feet are together but my pants cover the zipper part anyway so it s not a big deal i absolutely love these ankle high boots they are so cute and stylish they are a perfect boot for any occasion and go well with almost any style of clothing you have i have worn them to work as well as out on the town they are extremely comfortable and the block heel is the perfect height for me the memory foam insoles add much needed comfort and support to my feet i wore them all day at work and my feet never hurt i even wore them while shopping and never once had any foot pain i really like the look and feel of these boots you can definitely tell that they are very well made and very durable the rubber bottoms have ridges which makes me feel comfortable enough to walk in water or on a slippery surface the side zipper is very easy to zip and makes putting on the boots that much easier they are definitely true to size but are not too tight on my feet i still had plenty of room to move my toes around i am very impressed with these boots and will be purchasing many more pairs i highly recommend this product this time and tru ankle zipper booties are really nice they are simple but yet stylish with the outer side zipper they look good with jeans especially skinny jeans i think they would be great with dresses and skirts too they have a light memory foam sole which for me is not enough i need more cushion than that but it maybe perfectly good for someone else most shoes are not comfortable enough for me i tend to have to add an insole in them they reach directly at my ankle i have to wear them with socks otherwise they rub and scratches my ankle they do look great with ankle socks i love the 1 inch heel which makes them easy to walk in the rubber bottom means no slipping and sliding the wide width is great for my wide feet it has lots of room no squeezing my toes they seem to be true to size i haven t worn these booties for a long time so i can t say how well they will do on my feet for hours overall i am very happy with them i love the fit of this boots the size i have is 7 1 2 wide it is true to size my feet are flat and wide and i can wear socks with these boots and they still make my feet look normal the zipper on the side makes it easy to slide on and off the slight heel makes this a comfortable walking boot the style of the boot is today s fashion these boots go with a

447,Women Crew Neck Short Sleeve Stripes Leopard Print Top,17.99,4.2,408.0,great 100 beautiful and soft fits well but not quite the color i expected washes well really neat design cute shirt not true to size be careful take care cute top my new favorite shirt sorry 3 tops semi good perfect t shirt,i simply love this item it fits and feels really good and it covers the rear end of the body the color is great deep and true and it is a great fit for me absolutely loved it so soft no wrinkles beautiful look bought one also for my daughter needmore shirts this comfortable i love this item so i ordered all of the colors that were available i have gotten so many compliments from my co workers and they ask where did i purchase it it is a great fit and the colors are so true this shirt is very soft and beautiful the sizes are smaller than original size so order 2 sizes larger at least my mother actually got this shirt since the size was very snug on me this top is very soft and fits nicely but i think it s a brighter red than the picture shows i was hoping for that deep burgundy color that being said it s a beautiful deep red and since it fits so well i decided to keep it nice quality and yes looks better on the beautiful young model especially with professional photographer lighting but was very pleased with the shirt it washes well and is stretch comfy i bought 2 and am happy could have waited for a better price but hey who might live that long these days i ordered the white long sleeved khaki long sleeved and khaki short sleeved tees delivery was way fast and these tees are gorgeous the colors are exactly the same as the pictures the 1 downside is that whoever packed the short sleeved tee seems to have bled on it since there is a small stain on the front which when magnified sure looks like blood i m soaking it now i would have given this 4 stars but the wine color is not really wine its more red than anything i also wish it was slightly more fitted but it ll do i normally wear a large but ordered an extra large just so it would be loose and cool in the summer when i put it on i was very surprised to see that it was tight on me was not true to size i was unable to return them to local walmart store was also unable to return to supplier i believe they came from china i never expected to buy anything from walmart that i could not return to them will probably not but clothing on line again from them this star is for the print very pretty top however this woman xl actually fit a nine year old little girl so yeah that was pretty disappointing for the adult maybe it was just one of the many posts i see so often with incorrect information whatever the reason the disappointment was deep i couldn t be bothered to return it by mail and i am not able to go to the store just take care if you are a home bound online shopper like me this top fits small it is tight on the arms bust and hips the shoulders fit well so if i were to order a larger size i think it would drape sloppily over the shoulders i regret this purchase and would not buy again i love this shirt the color is great nice feel and very cute it is bit on the sheer side but wearing the right bra works wonders i adore this brand love love love this shirt the green is really soft the fabric and stitching are great quality the fit is great and sizing is true i wear a medium at 5 9 150 i really like this brand this was undersized by 2 sizes i had to give it to my daughter 19 00 gone was very disappointed have never had a problem with the right size from walmart until this top after getting the correct size which i goofed on it is very comfortable and cute i m waiting on the other 2 tops i ordered the company is very nice and sent me the correct size in a very fast response very much appreciated the fabric is a little thin mostly bought it for walking with some leggings the length is great but for the price it should be better if you buy get it one size up loved the design however the knit is a extremely thin material you can see colored bra through the gray i love it its the perfect t shirt not too thick not too thin perfect length i ordered them in different colors i loved them so much i ordered a woman s medium and it fit like a medium for a girl aged 8 you would have to stretch the top to the inch of its life to get it to look longer like in the picture notice how she is pulling down the top in the picture case in point,women's clothing,0
448,STARVNC Women Stripe Splice Long Sleeve Crew Neck Shirt,17.99,4.3,430.0,cool long sleeve sporty pullover shirt fun comfortable affordable shirt awesome delivery problem runs small neck was too big i m too short and fat for this lol awsome sporty look awesome fun shirt don t waste your money it came damaged nice top good shirt nice casual but runs a little large,nothing wrong with this shirt but not very complimentary to an 80 year old woman i was looking for a comfortable around the house shirt to hang out in and i got exactly what i ordered i think this is the young folks style now so they d get a great shirt if they ordered i love this shirt fits exactly as shown in picture you can get this shirt in long sleeves or short sleeves they are very comfortable and not a heavy shirt looks very good on i love this shirt i m always reluctant to order tops online since i m very tall and thin often resulting in shirts being too short on me i m 5 9 140 pounds and bought size medium it fits me perfectly see photo attached i love the material it s really soft and it s slightly different from the typical baseball athletic style shirt making it unique it s a fun comfortable affordable shirt love this shirt comfortable and light nmaterial sleeves for summer love the cut and style size seems to be true to what i ordered quick delivery and the driver was actually going to knock on my door and not leave it on the porch in the rain kudos to the delivery gal like the shirts but 1st order did not get one of my shirts this 2nd order still haven t received 2 of my shirts cute shirt but runs small had to return nice shirt but it runs very small and the fabric is quite thin i wear a medium and this one was quite tight size up unless you want a snug shirt sloppy neckline cute shirt the weight of it is nice especially for cool weather like fall there is a nice selection of colors to choose from too my only complaint is the neck was really big and stretched out i could not get it to set right without looking terrible evidently one must be 100 lbs and 6 foot tall to look anything like the photo of this shirt it is boxy and very long as others have mentioned it is nice to wear around home but i feel like it is more of a pajama top than something to wear out of the house at least for me 5 4 and 175 lbs and i got an xl color doesn t look the same as the pink pictured either i ll keep it for home use but will not be purchasing other colors as i hoped i would be after receiving the first one love the style and cut size is true to what i ordered driver great as she was actually going to knock on my door and not leave on the porch in the rain kudos to the driver these are fine shirts and look good on nice material not to thick wear a med but got the large love the long sleeves and does look good with shorts and jeans pants skirts the material has tiny stitch balls one of those fuzzy stich balls looked like it may run and become a hole so i returned the shirt so the material is thin i ordered this shirt before reading the reviews while waiting for it to be delivered i found the reviews which had me very worried about what i would receive upon arrival i was pleased with the quality and comfort of this shirt and have no issues with it perfect fun shirt to have the soft comfortable material is great not to thick or not to thin i have always thought these shirts were so cute and change from my other tees wore with my leggings and made feel a bit sassy rec d before expected so another bonus would love to have in red and navy blue dry clean i think not i hand washed it in woolite for delicates and laid it flat to dry the cut is boxy and unflattering it doesn t breath and it s hot it s not a t shirt or sweatshirt it s that cheap silky material i never wear it the couple of times i did wear it i had to change into something that had some cotton in it i don t think i ll ever wear it again but it s not in the trash yet it s a very nice long sleeve t shirt the colors are pretty and it s very soft however it came with a hole on the seam where the sleeve connects to the shirt about an inch and a half long the company doesn t do replace only returns so i m just going to sew the hole myself that s the reason for 3 stars also it smells kinda yucky i was very happy with the top and i m going to order another in a different color fabric is a nice quality and made well it is soft and held up to washing i really like the shirt but for me the sleeves are too tight i m not the hulk but i like loose shirts haven t washed it yet so i m reserving judgment and hoping it doesn t shrink nice casual shirt runs a little larger i m between a med and a lg so i order the large and it s larges through the hips than i prefer but will keep it ncare states dry clean only but it s 95 polyester and 5 cotton so i m going to wash it,women's clothing,0
449,"Blissful Benefits by Warner's® Women's No Muffin Top Seamless Brief, 3-Pack",7.0,4.5,267.0,no digging amazing great but one complaint comfortable but dolz says blissful benefits by warner s just okay soft and comfortable good news bad news let s be honest here no muffin top poor quality comfortable great brief panties comfortable and stretchy they do cause a vpl these are so comfortable ok briefs with my own alterations seamless panties perfect panties for sensitive skin,blissful benefits no muffin top seamless briefs are great if you re looking for a panty that is soft and seamless the wide waist band is seamless so a thick seam won t dig in your waist and it sits high on the waist so they re not always falling down the legs are seamless so they re not digging into your legs or seen through your tighter pants and because of the high waist band it keeps everything in on your sides and higher up your back so nothing shows when you bend over this review was collected as part of a promotion i got these underwear as it was definitely time for some new ones i really wasn t sure what to expect because finding good underwear isn t easy especially if you are a bigger woman like myself and you are also looking for comfort and something that fits well this package that i decided to get said that they are seamless that got me right off the bat because sometimes the seams even in underwear can be pretty uncomfortable these truly do not have any seams at all and that is part of what makes these so amazing they are also made of a silky material which feels really good on your skin these came 3 pairs to a pack i have already washed and dried 2 pairs of these and they held up really well they didnt snag or anything the feel of the material didnt change and neither did the way they fit this was a brand i had never tried before but i will definitely be buying more and have already recommended them to other women i know i cannot wait to get more of these this review was collected as part of a promotion they fit great and are very comfortable my only complaint is that pads and panty liners do not stick to them if you are someone that needs those products i would choose something else nice fit smooth and comfortable but i gave these a 4 rating because until you put them through a laundering a sanitary pad won t adhere well to the crotch part notherwise i really like them had higher expectations they are comfortable and i like that they are seamless but the boast of no muffin top doesn t ring true for my particular kind of apple body shape i can see how they would work for others but my shape is just the wrong one for this product they were stretchier than i thought they d be love the colors they are very soft i didn t dry them in the dryer because i go to a laundromat and was afraid they d get too hot but they wear nice and are comfortable first the good news these are super comfortable and jeans slide right over nthe bad news these are in no way useful for flattening a muffin top the three seams you see in the picture are not tighter than the surrounding fabric no shaping at all none other note if you wear stick on panti liners pads incontinence pads they will not stick to this fabric and there is no cotton lining nif you are looking for a smooth comfortable pair of panties that does nothing else but make you feel good these are great don t believe everything you read these briefs do have some muffin top they are also made out of some kind of nylon material that in fact runs like stocking nylons it s a softer material than cotton but these briefs are nothing to get excited about i don t put on my rings until after i m fully dressed i was very disappointed in this item the inside of each pair had raveled stitching on the hip area and pulls there is also no cotton crotch area and the entire panty has a cheap nylon feel to it very disappointed since ive bought other panties with the muffin to benefit in store not for me not sure why these are called no muffin top these did not hold in my tummy or add any more support than regular briefs i love warner s panties the grey pair had picks on them when i got them out of the package these can t compare to the previous ones i have bought these fit great however the material is already coming apart in the crotch area after two washings i would never purchase these again very comfortable not binding nwash nicely in washing machine i dont like the material your pants slide off you with the slick material but they are very comfortable and the muffin top works other than the material i recommend these panties these blissful benefits by warner s women s no muffin top seamless brief 3 pack panties have a lot of stretch the waistband is very comfortable and does eliminate that muffin top problem seamless yeah right these panties are comfy but they legs have a seam which means they do give a viable panty line but they are stretchy and comfy i guess i love that these came in 3 colors these are very breathable and they are super comfortable i would highly recommend these for anyone looking for that extra bit of comfort these briefs stay in place wash and dry well on medium settings the only negative panty liners do not adhere to this type of fabric i have had to sew my own cotton gusset so panty liners will stay in place they fit perfect i love the material they are very sof and comfortable i will definitely refer to my friends and family this review was collected as part of a promotion my daughter is 8 and hard to fit she loves these seamless panties and they do not ride up on her perfect fit,women's clothing,0

454,Champion Women's Powerblend Fleece Open Bottom Pants,18.39,4.4,196.0,not your husband s sweats comfiest sweats i have ever owned by far very comfy nice looking pockets a huge plus uber comfortable super comfortable nice sweat pants great fit sweatpants don t buy not fleece material would buy again but love that it has pockets oddly tight legs cut for twiggy great sweatpants comfy and good fit great product satisfied customer happy customer ok sweats,i bought one pair for a camping trip chosen because they have pockets and are more complimentary than men s sweats loved them so much i had to buy two more very flattering fit not too bulky plenty of length nice waistband and pockets wish they came in more colors these sweat pants are the best sweats i ve ever purchased and i ve been buying and wearing sweats for many many years i love the full pockets the length the comfort of these sweats i can t imagine not wearing these every day nthey fit true to size i purchased a small as i always do these have plenty of room so i can t imagine sizing up unless you re between sizes and unsure they washed well and did not shrink these fit true to size i always buy a small and these are a small with plenty of room but not baggy very comfy it s difficult to take them off they are great for leisure bedtime and even to go out and about as they are very nice looking what with the very functional pockets i love the length plenty long and did not shrink these are by far my favorite sweat pants and i have worn sweatpants for many decades very comfy although a bit long for me nice sizeable pockets that don t bulge out thought they might shrink a bit after washing and drying but held their length i absolutely love these pants they re comfortable and the length is perfect they re longer than most sweat pants out there this is actually my second pair i am 5 9 135lbs female with a straighter build i wanted to compare these women s champions to a men s medium i gave these a 4 only because for me the hip area is cut too wide and i will be returning them in favor of men s champion sweat pants i liked the fit being a round 5ft 6 in and even though they are soft and comfortable i didnt like the way the pant attracted dust and the pockets werent deep enough for me the fit and the style are perfect but the fabric is flimsy and is not wearing well i have other champion sweat pants on my shelf for years which do not have the signs of wear these have pilling at pressure points and wearing of outer fabric the washing directions are inaccurate i bought the matching sweatshirt and the lent was so awful that i won t be able to wear either of them an absolute waste of money these are not fleece they are regular sweatpants they are very long with very wide legs and hip area i ordered a medium which is what i order all the time in other brands and these were huge they only thing that was medium was the waistband i returned them i would buy these pants again if the leg size wasn t so long i had a 5 7 friend put on the pants and they fit her fine but still a little long definitely for a taller person i m 5 4 everything else is okay i ve been looking for comfy warm sweat pants that weren t baggy or too skinny legged all year and these are prefect they re warm comfortable they fit well without being bulky or skin tight and the fact that they have pockets just makes them amazing the legs on these pants are oddly narrow for sweat pants they fit like skinny jeans and don t have much stretch so they are hard to do stretching or anything athletic in the waist isn t small its generous enough its just the legs are really tight compared to other sweat pants i have they are comfortable and the quality seems average for chinese stuff but the tightness of the legs especially in the upper thigh area makes them good for pjs and little else ordered these a size larger as some reviewers had mentioned and they were still way too small the thighs are cut only slightly larger than the knees fine if you re a supermodel with absolutely no curves but not a good choice for an average person fabric is goid quality and they look nice just don t fit at all had to reorder pants due to improper order fill and shipping love these pants they have pockets elastic tie sit just above hipbone i m 5 1 weigh 138 i bought lg they do shrink a tiny bit but i like my sweats a lil loose very soft very comfy definitely would recommend these for lounging around love these pants very comfy nice soft fabric length was perfect i am 5 6 and ordered a large was delivery sooner than the estimated delivery date great pants very satisfied with the purchase i really love these pants they are cozy warm fit nicely and i love the look of them very nice quality of pants thanks i really love these pants they are cozy warm fit nicely and i love the look of them very nice quality of pants thanks not as soft or cuddly as i thought fit okay love the pockets waist could be stretchier i am 5ft 9 and weigh 140 long enough in the rise bought a size large,women's clothing,0

456,Hanes Sport™ Cool DRI® Women's Performance Long-Sleeve T-Shirt,9.0,4.4,662.0,love the cool dri long sleeve top a good purchase can t beat the price good shirt for warm weather hanes sport long sleeve t shirt very cool hang dry only good quality soft material thicker fabric than expected good sun protection good for custom painted sun protection comfy effective and great value comfortable brightly colored shirts cool dri women s performance long sleeve t shirt excellent lightweight shirt not a fan quality t shirts for exercising nice but hot not comfortable fits great but too vibrant for me,i live in orlando and work at disney world it is sticky sunny wet and gross during the summer so i bought 2 to keep me from burning and to wick away sweat they are perfect i feel more cool in this long sleeve than i did in the cotton polo provided i purchased this shirt for my mom who likes to do a lot of yardwork and gardening she s told me how this shirt has helped to keep her comfortable during these hot and sometimes humid ohio summer days we re also big fans of the color it s a bold energizing color for our outdoor activities i ll also note my husband and i also bought similar male versions of this shirt last year couldn t find a woman s shirt for me at the time we used the shirts when kayaking in florida and they were fantastic i definitely recommend this shirt i purchased these to take on a trip to tropical area because of their spf content and ability to wick moisture dry quickly love the colors and the price was unbeatable i wear a xl and found they do run a little bit big and length falls below hips and not on the hips nice shirt very comfortable true to size fits well sleeves are a good length i like the shirt i use it while running outside when it s cold i like the wick away property it goes into the washer and dryer no problem it s not fitted to my body but i don t care for when i m exercising surprisingly it s a bit see through if you wear a patterned bra you could see it this top kept me cool and dry maybe too cool because when i entered my air conditioned house it made me cold i have five of these tops in different colors and i managed to ruin one by tossing it in the dryer the almost neon quality of the color faded a lot and kind of darkened very disappointing because i purchased this one specifically for visibility while hiking so i replaced it with a new one the other colors are wearing just fine and i am extremely careful to only hang them all to dry now overall a solid 4 soft moisture wicking material very comfortable good craftsmanship ni found them a bit short but i m busty so that s a factor runs true to size notherwise great purchase would recommend i purchased to use for outdoor work in the yard i am small framed and like the fact the shirt is loose and not tight fitting cooler than tight fitting the only reason it lost starts was because the fabric is thicker than expected this is not the authentic patented cool dri like the mens version it is simply hanes sport on the tag when florida gets into the heat of the summer i can judge this thicker material better so far it is working out ok my husband has the actual cool dri and you can feel the difference so i would still recommend this product if you don t mind the slightly thicker fabric it would be nice if there was a wider choice of lighter colors as well i purchased the light and dark blue i just feel it should not be advertised as cool dri when the tags do not indicate it has cool dri technology plus it is made in a different county than my husbands authentic cool dri hope this helps i bought four of these to custom paint and use as sun protection in the desert they make me hot they are not extremely breathable but they are long sleeved so it s not completely surprising the biggest problem is that the seem along the sleeve fuzzes up making it look like it s very old when it s very new n noverall i m glad i bought them for my purpose for the quality they should cost much less comfy effective and great value works as well as the more expensive ones i have bought i bought several of these shirts as gifts the shirts were very well received the fabric is soft and comfortable and the colors are bright nice shirts i am pleased with the order this shirt met all expectations on very hot and humid day while wearing this shirt i was able to work outdoors gardening for hours no sunburn no insect bites and the shirt s fabric drew sweat away from my skin i have five of these now they keep the sun off me without overheating good quality bright colors a little long for me and a touch big i am 5 8 and 150 lbs i bought size large i ordered an xl and it fits like m l too tight around the neck shoulders chest and the shirt is too short to tuck overall i would say order 1 to 2 sizes larger and im not a fan of the cool dri fabric just feels like a staunch polyester i bought 3 hanes performance t shirts and love them great quality and the colors are so vivid i pair them with a sweatshirt or jacket for my cold morning walks bought this as alt pj top fit is nice so is the color the top is soft but it s a workout gear type material i get hot easily so this definitely keeps the heat in my only cavit allows you to move while still fitted happy w purchase the material is weird it sticks to my skin and not comfortable i just missed the return window bought in the summer in anticipation of winter so didn t realize in time this shirt was uncomfortable i like these shirts i bought four to wear for hiking and mosquitoes i thought these would be perfect being the cool dry material i order xxl because of others reviews saying they run a little big only one of them fit the way i like returning the rest im larger on top so i need to wear the larger sizes i think this is nearly perfect except the model looks much better in this pink than me i have very fair skin and the pink is super vibrant and makes me look extra pale this will be great for running in the fall evenings because of the bright colors cool material and hoping it will keep mosquitos off more love the price and fit is nice i sized up one size and its a comfy and roomy fit for exercise or just lounging,women's clothing,0

patterned one s when received my daughter decided it was soft comfortable had pockets she would steal one from me so i had to order more they are so comfortable wash well etc so ordered more in different colors and patterns available i have no complaints these gowns are absolutely perfect very soft very comfortable i love them i ordered 4 more as i have fibromyalgia and wear lounge wear alot these are perfect first got xtra large have to return reordered in large i m 155lbs 5 5 measurements are 42 37 37 love them same secret treasures quality i love the fact it looks like a dress but actually is sleepwear the feel of the material is very soft against my skin i plan to purchase other colors thanks i bought 3 of these and like them very much be aware that the lighter colors are somewhat transparent stick with the dark colors if you want no see through perfect in every way true to size soft and arms holes were just right i m always concerned when buying a sleeveless item because the arm holes are often way to big these are perfect i bought two but i plan to get one of each i purchased two gowns in an xl they ran a bit large but i liked them so i went on and ordered two in navy blue in an l size when they arrived they were by a different maker their size large runs smaller the smaller ones are by layla and the ones that ran large were secret treasures the material is already pilling after washing the secret treasures so i have been making sure to wash them inside out in a lingerie bag a little more care than i wanted to do but not a big deal they are ok for the price so just average rating i do love that they have pockets though i ordered this as it looked exactly the same style as another secret treasures tagless nightgowns i have purchased just a different color the nightgown that arrived had a tag with the brand layla not secret treasures and the cut was tighter than usual not happy that this is not what is shown online i have been a huge fan of secret treasures for years i love this style gown and always snap up several when they become available i had noticed a reviewer stated the tag said layla but ordered anyway i wisely only opened and washed one of the 3 i bought and when i tried it on sure enough it was not sized liked the secret treasures i have grown to love an xl in this one comes up too far under my armpits and the length is much shorter than usual nothing like the length in the pic i even took another from the bag and held it up to see if something had gone wrong in the wash nope still smaller than usual i went ahead and ordered a couple of 2x because the material and quality seem the same as secret treasures and this style is so hard to find i ll just have to return the others i did not try on ugh love i bought three of these in different patterns i bought one first loved it so much i went in and bought the other two can t beat them for that price perfect in every way true to size soft and arms holes were just right i m always concerned when buying a sleeveless item because the arm holes are often way to big these are perfect i bought two but i plan to get one of each i love these night gowns if you wear a 3x don t worry it will fit you i love they have side pockets too i bought the viola floral black grey floral and black multi floral i wasn t disappointed very good for the price the prints are not exactly sophisticated but they are pretty enough soft and easy to sleep in i got two and i will wear these a lot i love this nightgown i like the fit its lightweight and very soft it washes well i hang it to dry it is very pretty and comfortable it covers all areas that should be covered i really live these gowns i have ordered several i different colors and patterns the fabric is so soft and comfortable they are good quality and wash well i recommend them i loved the the first one that i bought so much that i bought five more by far the most comfortable gowns i have ever owned the fabric is so soft and stretchy the pockets are awesome if you are tall the length of these gowns are amazing these nightgowns are so soft and i ordered mine to big but i still wear all three cuz they are so comply i loved these so much i bought in every color i am a size 5x and found the fit fantastic and the soft material wonderful these are the softest most comfortable gowns i ve owned i

462,Assurance S/M Unisex Overnight Underwear 16ct,7.88,4.6,172.0,you can be assured they are good best overnight product a great help the best overnight underwear finally adult disposable underwear that works one of the best bargains around finally something that truly works awesome for someone who has no control and night great job best ever excellent product great price great product,i almost don t want to say how good these are for fear i won t ever be able to find any on the shelf i use these on my 100 year old mother at night she is not incontinent but she is a frequent nighttime bathroom user and these allow me to get sleep instead of getting her up every 2 hours they hold as much liquid as the more expensive kind which are twice the price i recently ordered 10 packages online for delivery because of covid 19 since the only downfall of this product is i never can find more than 1 4 packages on the shelf no matter what walmart i go to and sometimes i don t find any others must know how good they are too this works well for the side sleepers with minimum leaks this is far better product than depends w pads added which only leaked most of the time this product doesn t leak hardly ever because it has a leak guard i m so glad i found these for my mom i have tried all the heavy duty and overnight underwear and this is by far the best one hard to find in the stores but no problem online order a case and that comes out to just a little over 5 a package great product great price free delivery for 2 cases the capacity of this underwear is amazing i care for my wife who has dementia without this technology product the job would be almost impossible for me having this aspect of her care under control makes the job manageable i have had to use other brands these are great ive tried many brands for my 96 yr old mother these hold up the best she will finish up the other brands and we will stick with these from now on give them a try youll like them too i strongly recommend them i have been on the hunt for leakage proof odor free adult disposable underwear for my dad for months i ve tried different types of brands with the last one being tena which was was quite expensive i was more than willing to pay just about any price for a product that met my dad s incontinence needs however nothing i purchased prior to this brand worked i did some extensive search and read very good reviews on the assurance unisex overnight brand and decided to try them out i found the cost to be very reasonable much cheaper than the tena brand but once again my concern was not about cost i just wanted something that worked for my dad viola these work wonderfully excellent fit leakage and order proof the only negative for me is that 64ct is not available to purchase in the stores so i have to opt for shipping instead i prefer to buy in bulk not to mention the 64ct is a better deal than the 16ct it took longer to arrive than i expected but not a deal breaker for me comfortable and very good fit these are high capacity and are as good as any of the popular name brand products and actually much better than most the cost is quite modest and ordering a greater quantity from walmart on the internet 8 packages in my case they are very inexpensive buy a single package at the store to try them out and i bet you will be as pleasantly surprised as i was i won t buy any other brand from now on after trying several brands including depends these work best for my mother who has bladder issues keeps the bed dry and are very comfortable i woke up in november 2018 a paraplegic thus is why at 48 i had to find a way to stay dry through the sleeping hours waking up wet isn t fun for anyone so after trying many different products my wife grabbed the walmart brand because it was all they had it is the best protection i have ever had so try the assurance equate you won t be disappointed i order these for a family member i had been ordering them a case at a time but now it seems they are out of stock they are cheaper by the case however you can order limit 3 separately for 7 88 each compared to 20 00 ish for a case of four good product plz keep in stock cases thicker than needed now but they will really hold a lot for someone who has no control if you just leak get the lighter version but these will hold ya all night i had no problem with the product i just have not received my whole order yet i have reached out and still have not heard a word 4 pks were ordered but i only recieved 2 in the box that i received so pay for 4 but only got 2 hmm ngreat product when you get what you paid for this product is very comfortable and works for overnight it is usable by both males and females i have been buying this for over 2 years now and can not find anything that works better i received my order on a rainy day my package arrived in a plastic bag doesnt get wet and arrive on time these are good only thing wrong is i need a size small and you don t seem to have any i hope you have them soon i will have to stick with the depends until you have a small size thank you this is an excellent adult diaper it doesn t leak or fall apart the best price anywhere excellent product timely delivery most comfortable absorbent adult underwear i use these on my mom and they keep her really dry especially at night and the price is right also especially with

470,Athletic Works Women's Athleisure Flared Yoga Pant with Fold over Waistband in Regular and Petite,11.96,4.2,108.0,love them but received the wrong color the price is right nice but order size up good yoga pants true to size pleasantly surprised seam at waist sewn too tight skintight not happy good quality ok replacement for ny runs small not long enough comfortable perfect for short women i like the old ones better good buy,love how they fit and look i already had a black pair which i love my only gripe is that i ordered the dark navy this time and received another black pair super comfy pants that fit well i did not get what i ordered though ugh we love these pants they actually fit not too long they hold you in a little as well as keep us drier cooler at workout facilities easy to wash we use a detergent for dark clothing in cool water and keep their shape as well as the color i love these pants the fit was spot on ni ordered 3 pair and will be ordering more nwanda nb a ok nice but run small i like these because the length is right for a short person they are a thicker material there are no outside seams and they fold down however i am a petite person only weigh 95 lb and am 5 4 and the petite medium is tight crazy that i should have to order a large i only ordered one pair to check quality and fit but i will reorder a few more pairs the next size up decent yoga pants for the price i followed other reviewers advice and ordered a size up don t do this order your regular size i have to return the 2 pairs i purchased because they are too big the material is soft and about average thickness i am 5 3 and the petite length was perfect for me bought these to wear while i walk in fall winter because im other pants were worn i bought the xl and they are very comfortable and fell nice my only gripe is i do not like how the top folds over as it doesnt stay folded over my belly when i have them on i can squat easily and soft to skin and although i ought specifically for walking i have started wearing them on errands as they look and feel good thus making me feel good love the way they fit although they seems to run small glad i ordered a size up they seems to wash a dry well but fabric started pilling immediately in wear areas these pants are a nice material and look nice but the sizing was off for me the seam at the waist is sewn tight and i hear it tear when i put the pants on ughhh no visible holes or anything but not comfortable for me i have bought other pants from this brand that have fit beautifully but these pants were a huge disappointment they were completely skintight on my big legs and fit more like leggings and there was virtually no flare at the bottom they re uncomfortable and look horrible on me if you are thick in the stems don t buy these i m sending them back for a refund not as good of quality as if it was bought in the store not happy with the purchase i returned all of it the day after i received them in the mail not as advertised the quality is better than i expected the material is thick enough and they dont lose their shape ii got the petite but could have got the regular length i am 5 feet 2 out of all of the petite yoga pants from walmart they are my most preferred they do fit a little snug so if you want something a little loose this may not be for you 5 3 100 lb bought a s petite tight and short but the material is good could not return as i washed it might try a m the pants are stiff and a little rough to the touch definitely recommend washing before wearing after 2 washes they are still stiff but not as bad they are thick and comfortable they are not as long as i hoped for or read about in the review if you are considered on the tall side don t believe the hype they are not long enough i am 5 8 and they barely reach my ankles i have been looking everywhere for comfy black slacks and these are it at the best price hard to find these yoga pants that are shor enough for petite women i am 5 feet and the petite is a perfect length these are ok but not my favorite i don t know why walmart changed this product i loved the old ones i m sorry i didn t order more these are tight through the thighs and flare from the knee down the flare is a little big great comfortable pair of yoga pants the band isnt too tight either which is a problem i have with others perfect fits as it should be,women's clothing,0

472,Just My Size Women's Plus Size Fleece Zip Hood Jacket,12.96,4.5,883.0,fleece hoodies jackets in larger size i love them beautiful color fit fantastic cozy warm jacket at good price cute and warm size a little bummed sweatshirt is huge and oddly shaped fleece ecosmart hoodie the perfect hoodie happy owner of the fleece hoodie do not buy this made in the usa warm and soft runs small nice fabric not the same purchase of hoodie,i really like my hoodies they are soft and warm and very pretty i like my jacket but you may want to order a size up than what you wear i normally wear a 4x but got 5x that actually fit perfect i went by some previous reviews i got two of these in different colors they are super soft and warm i ordered a size bigger as i like to have extra room for a t shirt or blouse underneath and even with that it s still roomy and very comfortable on the first wear thus far it does leave lint on whatever i m wearing underneath but i suspect that ll stop after the first wash it s the perfect length also i ll be ordering more soon such a beautiful color and i wanted anything but gray it is just the right weight and size too i love this fleece zip hood jacket i had order one years ago and its already old and the color has faded so i treated myself in buying 3 two in black and one in purple my daughter loves it for work i expected it to be sweat jacket on the outside and fuzzy inside but it is fuzzy inside and out gave it a 4 star only because the zip up should be a bit more firm as to not catch on fuzzy material good value for price love these sweaters they are very soft they re medium weight for a sweater you can definitely feel the warmth from them on a chilly morning but don t feel too restricted if you re zipped up only reason i didn t give 5 starts is because i wish they were maybe 2 or 3 inches longer i know that s personal preference still a great buy at 12 i have 2 more in my cart different colors of course very soft and the fit is perfect the 2x is truly an 18 20 fit the description said it was cotton bit when i got it it had lots of polyester bummer i probably would not have ordered it if i had known it had mostly polyester in it as i was specifically looking for cotton i usually wear a size 5x in just my size but this was gigantic so i will be returning it i would probably need a 3x if i was to order a replacement the material was a nice weight and felt soft but the bottom band was insanely large like two sizes wider than the top the sleeve length was good but the bottom of the sleeve was narrow compared to the rest of the sweatshirt it is just an oddly shaped sweatshirt great fit and very comfortable it does fade with each wash but for the price it was very much worth it i will probably order another in a different color this hoodie is comfortable and washes up very well it is perfect for home or out and about i ve been wearing mine constantly since receiving it love it and i am considering purchasing another i love it it is proportioned well and doesn t look baggy and low qualility i get chills and sleep in it some times the zipper works wonderfully love it mary grimshaw didn t fit in the arms if you have long arms don t buy this not true to size size up not worth the hassle of returning good quality at a good price ordered arrived quickly with no problems very comfortable i find myself wearing my seatpants sweatshirt all the yime this is a heavier weight jacket so i will wear it for fall and winter i prefer the heavy weight materials over lighter weights in some sweat shirts these days i bought this in a 1x in teal aqua and it fits great color is good a little loose all around except the forearms these sleeves are tapered and not stretchy so if you like pulling up your sleeves to your elbows like i do some times it won t happen the inside is a soft white felt which isn t the best when wearing dark clothes underneath because lint will transfer i have been wearing his fleece for years i have always purchased size 22 24 which are roomy i purchased 2 jackets the black one the sleeves were snug as in don t wear anything w sleeves under it the steel grey jacket the sleeves were loose and it was comfortable but the coordinating pants i couldn t pull them up past mid thigh all are being returned ordered this to replace my old hoodie which i loved the new hoody is not the same fabric doesn t feel the same and lacks the heft of my old one i will wear it but will always prefer my old hoodie and wish the fabric composition had not changed the hoodie fit fine through and around my body however the sleeves were so narrow i couldn t wear them on my arms they appeared to be cut for a child at the top of the arms they were too small to be comfortable for even my wrist to fit through the upper arm they were the right size in length but the sleeves were about 66 too small for the garment it s like the hoodie was stitched for my size and the sleeves were stitched for a child,women's clothing,0
473,Hanes Women's Scoop Neck Tank,6.0,3.9,816.0,homebound easy shopping versatility at a bargain price comfy perfect for nursing home wear great buy order a size up nothing to write home about nice shirt but runs a little small scratchiest material and big armpit holes scoop neck tank comfortable and nice fit comfortable uneven sewing great all cotton tank top poor fit very nice scoop neck tank comfortable tank,hard to find 100per cent cotton not everyone carries plus size best of all convenient to order receive oh better yet the low price for well constructed clothing not everyone can afford high end dept stores or boutiques and god bless you for keeping your products affordable for everyone bought several in a variety of colors to wear while exercising nice fit fabric is soft i wear this under a larger tank so don t mind that the light pink is a bit thin they are well made comfy shirt great for iron ons these work great purchased them for my 88 year old mom who is in a nursing home staff said they are perfect and make it easier to dress her each day i was so happy to finally find a tank top that was mostly cotton and not stretchy i bought three of these and they re comfortable wash well and didn t shrink in the dryer low heat if you want a loose comfort fit a 2x will be similar to a roomy regular xl i like that they re 100 cotton but i didn t account for the shrinkage i should have ordered mediums i do like the natural fabrics so next time i ll order a size up the shoulders look wider in the pics than they actually are they are 1 1 4 max and provide far less coverage than i had hoped the length also shortened several inches when they were washed in cold water and dried on very low delicate heat looks more like a men s tank nice shirt but runs a little small i usually wear an extra large with no problem and this one does not fit i would suggest buying one size larger than you usually wear form fitting around the belly bought this to go to gym in i am 125 pound and belly looks like im 9 months prego and this tank shows every inch hard to find workout shirts when you are not skinny around the belly cause they are all form fitting like who wants to look like a beached whale people go to gym to loss pounds they should make tops loss fitting not form fitting this might be the worst cotton tank i ve ever purchased i sized up to a medium based on customer recommendations for reference i am 120 pounds and 34b the sizing was perfect but the fit and material was terrible the armpit holes flared out so bad it was bizarre the worst part about this tank is the fabric it is so scratchy and uncomfortable i couldn t even wear it in the house for five minutes i want to note that i washed and dried one of the tanks before i wore it i m sending these back these are a great addition to my wardrobe i will use them as an additional layer for warmth or an under blouse tank as weather permits wish they had more colors washed it and it was fine after the dryer these are the most comfortable tank tops i ve bought in a long time they aren t tight stretchy which i don t care for good length and comfortable fit i bought three of them the top fits pretty well and i m enjoying the colors it is not constructed terribly well however the fabric is not cut with the grain of the fabric so the body of the shirt twists a little with the bias since i ll mostly be layering these under other tops it probably will look ok i purchased this purple tank top and it doesn t fit right one side is fine the other armpit area is bigger than the other and when i folded it down the middle its obvious that it was sown unevenly totally disappointed now have to wear under something else ugh took a risk and purchased clothing online will not be doing this again love this all cotton tank i can t stand polyester or poly blend in my clothes so these are what i was looking for great as a shell under a blouse or shirt and also excellent for my workouts too i waited to review until after washing did not shrink or fade was very happy with the color selections and pricing too thanks i bought a medium and a large of this shirt hoping that perhaps one would fit nice the large size had the same problem as last year poor armhole fit the armholes are large and sort of stick out the medium was very small i keep hoping that hanes will address the armhole problem with these shirts i love your regular relaxed tees they fit great and i have a lot of them but summers in arizona require sleeves options now i have to look elsewhere for that option i received the 4 tanks i purchased about 3 weeks ago i actually wear these to sleep in but will likely pick up a few to wear out and about the fabric being 100 cotton is very nice they are not see through and are soft against the skin they hold their shape the arm holes are not huge and i appreciate that the colors are rich i got the petal purple amaranth navy and paleo pink took a star away because it runs small you need to order up 1 size have washed it a couple of times and it washes well has no tag so that is a plus bought the color blue and it is lighter then the color in the picture still a nice shade of blue i wear a size large and ordered an x large and it fits i stay cold even in summer and wear tanks under another shirt these fit me and are comfortable the price was right too i got it on sale i love the color the fit is the reason i returned it i m a bit large chested so on me it gapped at the front around the arms,women's clothing,0

482,Women's Plus Size Pullover Pockets Shirts Long Sleeve Blouse Casual Loose Tops,19.59,1.6,121.0,should be a 3x junior do not buy top is ugly not from walmart junk clothes poorly made you do not get whats in the picture ridiculous sizing not worth the price very disappointed not worth it terrible quality 3 sizes smaller than normal don t buy very disappointed nit anything like pictured awful awful quality and sizing is way off,there is no way a plus size woman could wear this i bought this for a christmas gift but when i pulled it out of the package it look like it could fit my 12 year old neighbor the material is great and it s nice and the shirt itself is nice but the sizes are way off this would probably fit somebody in the large and not 3x this shirt is nothing like the picture the material is extremely cheap the picture makes the product look like a sweater material when it is just a t shirt the shirt is also extremely short i do not recommend this product not worth the money the looks of the top compared to the top in person isnt anything at all compared to in person im very disappointed and it does not fit i ordered a 2x and it is more like an xlarge nothing like advertised the package came from china the material is cheap and thin size is no where near what i ordered there isn t even a manufacturer tag on the shirt just a cheap size tag very unhappy not even as describe don t waste your money and it will not fit a plus size extremely thin material thinner than a t shirt and about two sizes too small its not long goes to top off read end very cheap material extremely see through not at all like the picture very poor quality and unfortunately i bought 2 of them in the picture its a long oversized top and it barely past my waist i am normally a 3x and i ordered 5x according to measurements i am soooo disappointed i hate them waist of money not kidding i ordered the blue top in size 5xl i generally wear a 2x 3x but i wanted this shirt extra long and extra loose it was not it was so small i could barely pull it on whatever stretchiness the material had it was maxxed out the material was very thin and had it fit even remotely properly it would have required a tank top underneath very disappointed it s a shame because this brand had several other cute tops that i had been planning on buying but even at this low price it is no bargain i will be seeking a refund and will not be making any more purchases from this brand i can only comment on size alone i normally wear a 2x but ordered a 5x to layer and be comfortable i couldn t get my arms in the sleeves very disappointed it wasnt the quality of mayerial that i expected i have bought clothes from walmart before but will not do it again should have known i was introuble when all the packaging was in chinese the picture above is not what i ordered i ordered a size larger then what i typically where is tunic tops and it is still too small it is thin and not at all sweater material also it is short like a t shirt not a tunic this is the 2nd top i purchased that i will be sending back for this issue i don t know when walmart became wish but i hope they fix this soon very disappointed in this top i ordered 2 of them and the only thing about the looks is the color i thought it would be a longer fitting top like shown on the picture well it s like a regular t shirt i thought i would be getting something that would be warm with the weather changing and it diffently not true to size the sizes run very small i would like to send it back and get a refund but i don t feel like going through the hazel i guess i ll just have to wear them around the house but they are nothing i would say oh let me put this top on to go to a little friends gathering i don t want to give it any stars i wear a 1x ordered a 4x just in case it would be smaller than expected and i wanted something comfortable around the house it didn t fit at all way too small fabric is icky cheap and uncomfortable against the skin this item is not as pictured the material is very thin and almost se through the material pictured is not the same it also runs about 3 sizes smaller this is nothing like the picture it is not thet long the fabric is cheep and thin and i ordered a 2 x so it would be oversized and the tag may say 2x but its more like a medium very disappointing what i received is nothing like the photo portrayed i ordered my size but should have gone up two even with that being said the item is not as long as showed will try to return to walmart asap super thin material appears to be of very poor quality loose strings along several seems i am processing my return of this asap not worth their price not too sure i d even buy this if it had been sold by dollar tree the material is extremely thin says oversized but it is short and very tight in sleeves the material is a thin t shirt type material sorry in length unlike picture portrayed i bought this excited to wear it for fall but its very lightweight i also ordered a larger size so it would have extra room in it but i honestly could not get it on not at all i put my arms in and it was tight even on my arms so disappointed i wear a 1x ordered a 4x just in case it would be smaller than expected and i wanted something comfortable around the house it didn t fit at all way too small fabric is icky cheap and uncomfortable against the skin,women's clothing,0
483,Time and Tru Women's Pima Cotton Boyfriend T-shirt,8.98,4.3,548.0,perfect tee best boyfriend tee ever great fitting shirt good buy perfect tee shirts perfect t nice shirt but length can vary too short for me i like it awesome for short torso perfect very nice shirt but color was off this is ahhh mazing who thought of this uggghhh picky meg pleased with product true size,i tried this on a while ago in a medium and wasn t sure about it then i tried it again and sized up to a large for a little extra length and love it this tee will go effortlessly into each season can t wait to layer it with a chunky cardi and some boots showed different ways to style it on my insta mylifeinmomjeans follow me for other walmart finds and good deals after reading many reviews raving about this tee i bought a white to try it was looking for some boyfriend fir without it being too short crop tee this piece is perfect and without it being too short to show my mid section also the material is thicker than regular tee white is not see through such good fit and can t beat the price love the time and tru brand and find that i can always count on the clothing to fit me this top is nice and i like that it is a looser fit as it is good for warm weather i usually wear an xl but got the xxl and am happy with the extra room soft not too long like a lot of shirts are today sleeves are almost to the elbow which i love wish there were more colors to choose from if there were i would buy them can t beat the price they look good on and are easy to care for too i love these shirts they don t have scooped necks the sleeves are not real short and the bottom of the shirt is a little shorter than average always a little nervous ordering clothes online but this t shirt did not disappoint soft lightweight fabric but not too thin drapes attractively neither too tight nor baggy i like the slightly longer short sleeves too the shirt length is perfect if you like to not have to tuck it in when paired with a skirt for example glad the photo showed this this is a shirt that needs no breaking in and is true to size i ordered in black m and look forward to ordering more of them in other colors i ordered 2 different colors in this shirt the grey fit is great not too short but the blue one was 2 inches shorter at the hemline which made it unwearable for me so i handed it off to a shorter family member and ordered a third one i just found out its cancelled due to low quantities fits true to size not super long but not a crop able to tuck the front into my midrise pants sleeve on the xl hits me on the fullest part so it is a bit snug but overall reminiscence of a madewell shirt bought 3 white black i love the style of this shirt however mine came with a blue marker stain on the back i ve reached out to customer service via chat and it always tells me an agent will be with me and never appears other than the stain the shirt is very cute the good news walmart has stepped up its game in the clothing department i ve found the quality of their time and true brand to be strong and consistent these t shirts are high quality fabric for the price point nthe bad news like other reviewers the size is way too short i m 5 1 and the xl comes down slightly below my waist very disappointed bought 4 colors and they are all going back the fit was perfect loose so it didn t grab my hips just the right length for me at 5 4 nthe sleeves were long enough i will be looking to get another now that i have worn it na couple of times did i mention it is cotton these shirts are so soft i love the oversized fit for hanging around the house i have a really short torso and have the hardest time with tshirts they are usually way too long on me i will say if you are really tall or have a long torso this is going to be short on you for me this is perfect i ordered several more after my first i am 5 7 and 169lbs and i got a medium this is exactly what i was looking for i got the black and the white because i wanted simple tees to go with everything i was seeing cheaper options in stores but leave it to time and tru and walmart to get the right fit seriously worth every penny will probably buy more these shirts are more on the shorter size which is great because it falls in such a way that makes me look slimmer i don t know if that makes sense it s not a crop top but it s not as long as regular shirts which makes it easy to tuck into high waisted bottoms the shirt itself was a wonderful fit and material but the color is a bubble gum pink i thought it was more of a muted pink i wish the other colors would be in stock to ship because i would of bought all of them i ordered a size small and it fit perfect i am usually a small or a medium but since this is a oversized fit i went smaller which fit great if the color wasn t bubble gum pink i would of kept it love love love this shirt i am so happy that i have been able to buy a few of these in the past and they have not failed me praise god there is another boyfriend shirt that walmart has a pima boyfriend shirt that i bought and i wanted to throw that thing away after i wore it i didn t even want to take that one back just toss it but this one was spot on in fit style fashion wash resistance and in feel this one is the best thing smoking this shirt is the regular boyfriend shirt but cut off at the waist i thought it was a petite version then i thought it was those with short torsos then my mind ran to those that don t like tucking in their shirts but this shirt just feels awkward on you and makes you fell like its too small for you even though it physically fits your size its really different stick with the regular buttock length boyfriend shirt this is a great shirt not too thin and short enough to be convenient to get into pockets good fit and very comfortable t shirt fabric is soft not stiff very nice good material,women's clothing,0

485,Lee Women's Instantly Slims Straight Leg Jean,24.99,4.2,519.0,no plumber butt with comfy relaxed fit straight classic my new favorite jeans defined waist nice fit for hourglass shape perfect fitting jeans with straight leg love the fit inconsistent length mom jeans check size chart and measure waist before you buy would not buy again look and feel wonderful runs very small not true to size comfortable just ok jeans good pants,i bought three styles these are perfect size and style for me for indoor and warm weather the fleeced line are comfy and loose for outdoors third style was returned slim fit with a hint of stretchyness love them i used to wear the amanda by gloria vanderbilt same size 6 but the waist was a little too wide and the legs were a little too short these lee jeans are perfect they are my new go to jeans i wear the 6 and i am 5 7 and 135 lbs great higher rise jean if you have a defined waist fits nicely over cowboy boots if you re not a fan of bootcut jeans i ordered 8l am 5 8 and 150lbs attn the 8l in seattle color was not long only a 31 inseam 8l in black and horizon had an inseam of just over 33 i love these jeans for an hourglass shape these come the closest to actually fitting around the waist they have a good quality material and the length is just right for me i m 5 ft 5 1 2 i just tried these on and they fit perfectly i got the 12 short yes i ve gained about 15 pounds during covid 19 quarantine and they fit perfectly in the waist and length and around the bottom they re not form fitting so i m between a 10 and 12 and am only 5 0 tall i m a bit short waited as well and these were perfect the seams on the legs are straight sometimes some jeans curve a bit so they look good so classy looking with a nice blouse and the fit is super flattering i am a size 14 and have a booty these jeans flatter my body type and are easy to dress up i ordered this lee instantly slimming jean in black horizon and seattle in size 8l i am 5 8 and 150 lbs the nearly high rise fit is perfect for me but there was a discrepancy in length the black and horizon had an inseam of just over 33 while the seattle had an inseam of just 31 i ordered 2 pair of seattle and both had a 31 inseam i ll probably look to order from another source as i love the fit and this long jean is perfect with cowboy boots mom jeans might be cute on a very young lady but not on an actual mom sigh an extra star because they are very well made size is right and fit is nearly what i expected these jeans are just entirely too unflattering if you have even the tiniest hint of a belly podge and the waist is really really high on a petite person i have two other pairs of lee instantly slimming jeans in a size 14l that fit the way they should these pants are well made and fit fine through the hips rear end and legs but are definitely too tight around the waist and therein lies the difference between these pants and the others these fit at the waist while the others are both midrise i think you could probably go with up to a 36 waist in a 14 but any more than that will be too tight i m afraid that a 1 6 will fit me at the waist but will bag on me everywhere else so while they sure do slim you across the stomach you will suffer some discomfort if you try to wear them for any length of time if the waist is too tight made in egypt poor quality for lee ordered 3 pair all fit differently did not put in dryer afraid of shrinking would not buy again and i have worn lees foy years bought a size 6 and they fit so comfortable i ve gained a few pounds since covid 19 hit us and my usual favorite jeans now cause the dreaded muffin top not a problem with these look and feel wonderful these fit perfectly and they work on ladies and not just teens size 7 in medium length 5 ft 2 is perfect in length and in medium skinny length they wash well and are super mostly cotton material the price is great too although if they fit i m sure that they would be comfortable these run exceptionally small lee tops do not so i had no way of knowing that lee pants did returned like the fit very much i ve been looking awhile for a pair of jeans that fit well and these are nearly perfect i m happy to have found them finally little big in the waist not really a true tapered leg the length should be a couple inches longer for tall but i sew and i m able to make some adjustments these jeans were just what i was looking for they are very slimming soft and comfortable to wear love these jeans i bought size 18 long i am 6 ft tall and weigh 196 they fit beautifully love the look of them also i may order more colors they fit very well at almost seventy my body habits has changed u like high waist straight leg jeans and the are perfect and they look good on me and are very comfortable at first the pants looked fine but after wearing them for a while they start to lose shape and are very wrinkled so the slimming effect isn t there as stated denim is too light weight but that is what you get with the stretch jeans the non stretch usually shrink and don t fit,women's clothing,0

489,"Hanes Women's Perfect Coverage ComfortFlex Fit Wirefree Bra, Style G260",7.95,3.8,1165.0,amazing bra good support great bre at a great price had to customize but love them first time increasingly uncomfortable with wear not for plus size wom i like yet i don t poor quality very dissapointed best bra happy customer terrible strap design straps are too short cups are pointy great buy comfortable and fit well wearing one right now and almost forgot about it poor choice on material nice bra bra worth buying,i just got this bra today and i am in love so very comfortable yet stylish i wear a 36b and the medium fits perfectly will definitely order more in the future very comfortable my go to bra for everyday use i ride horses so i need a lot of support and these bras do well without the pain that comes with underwire i wish there was more coverage into the underarm to smooth out things but i can live without it this is a comfortable bra it fits very well it offers nice support it s very attractive it s offered in lots of great colors this is a great bra offered at a very affordable price i ordered one bra and liked it so much i quickly ordered another i brought three of these wirefree bras to wear in the house i did not like the padding so i cut the padding out and now these bras are the most comfortable for me when i m in the house or doing yard work gives me enough support to keep the girls alert and i have even fallen asleep wearing them for the price i paid it was worth me cutting the padding out and keeping them first time trying this brand i always love their other products this bra seemed great at first no uncomfortable underwires and a fair amount of support after a day of wear it became increasingly uncomfortable it felt like there was stiff uncomfortable fabric along the sides this not a good choice for plus size women i think if the band around the chest was another 2 inches wider at least especially for the larger sizes like 38 and or d it would might help but as it s currently made it just rolls up and has no support on the sides it extenuates back rolls i really like these they fit great soft and comfortable but the type of fabric pills under the arm pit and the sides of the cups i don t know of anyway to remove the pills without ruining them i only buy them for the fact i know they will fit and of course the price so i guess you get what you pay for i d rather pay for a bra that is made of a fabric that doesn t pill after wearing only a few times but who has that sort of money the photo is of a bra that was only worn 4 times and hand washed in between wearing i never wear the same one more than 2 days in a row so that isn t the issue it s the fabric poor quality very poor quality and finishing if it was on the insides i d have ignored it but it s on the outside how disappointing run small compare to other hanes bra products plus the shoulder strings which are the support did feel very rough for any kind of skin i still have not used any of them nor i am planning to use them i was trying to return them all but is been hard for me to find the place in the website to do so n nthanks this bra is soft well fitting and comfortable to wear this is the 2nd of these bras tat i own and are my favorites love these bras and they didnt have the aize i neesed in the store so i decided to order which i will do from now on cause they are cheaper online and a bigger selection i have been buying this style of bra for several years and this is the first time i have been anything but comfortable in one the problem is the strap design the straps are no longer made of a stretchy satin ribbon type elastic with the raw ends tucked under instead they are made of a stiff fabric that is sewn to a small amount of smooth elastic in the back the raw edges overlap around the top of the shoulder blade and irritate the skin by the end of the day i had sore areas on my collar bone the top of my shoulders and my back where the elastic and bra fabrics overlap you don t notice this when you try the bra on in the store but by the end of the day you can be miserable the straps are fabric wrapped with bias cut strips which are then serged all of these layers are against your skin and can be very irritating also for some reason they moved the strap adjusters to the back so that you have to slip it off to guess what would be the right size then try it on and repeat until you get it right i still love hanes and plan to try their bras again when the strap design is changed remember dear hanes customers would rather pay a tiny bit more for quality than end up with something unwearable cluttering their closets even at their longest the straps are too short the cups are weird kind of pointy i ve had this bra for over a year and i ve only worn it maybe four or five times it s very uncomfortable and i find myself yanking at the band to try and pull it down all the time i ve always had a problem with many of my bras either the cup is too big too little or the waistband is too loose or tight i figured let me try these because they looked very comfortable i m glad i did this is the best fitting bra for me it s super comfortable covers me entirely also love the shape it gives me with my shirts on will definitely buy me a few more thanks they are made well and fit as expected i wish they were made with a better fabric that could stand up to use because the only problem i have is that the fabric pills after wearing several times from rubbing against other clothing and body parts you have to carefully use a tiny scissors and carefully remove each pill you can t use a clothing shaver to remove as it will cause a hole in the fabric i always hand wash and dry so that s not the issue and i only wear them 2 times before wearing another one so with that they are well cared for with my use they are comfortable to wear as well i ve tried to add a photo as the option is there but it won t highlight so i can add one i am not enamored of the straps or the fact that i ordered a band size that should have been way bigger than the bras i already own but isn t it is somewhat bigger but i am guessing this company sizes the band to be exactly so when on the last hooks before the end instead of the middle or other end like more generous companies do also the band has very little stretch as do the straps which could be a good or bad thing depending on what you expect when you purchase them for me big shouldered and overweight the straps at their loosest setting barely get over my shoulders and do what needs to be done all that being said despite the straps and band being tighter and less giving than expected i am sitting here wearing a bra for the first time in weeks and feeling almost perfectly comfortable i d be annoyed more if i hadn t gotten them so cheap but for the price they are pretty darned nice you ll pardon me for not adding photos there is a plastic like material used surrounding the area of the bra where the beat would test that is uncomfortably irritating to my skin it feels as if a tag is poking my skin and unable to remove it i should ve tried one on before i bought five and now i regret it i had seen this in a store better price online and went up a size which worked because of clasp at back this is a very comfortable bra without an underwire it fits well i advise washing by hand as it will pill if put in the washer and dryer its worth it i bought this bra before,women's clothing,0
490,Secret Treasures Women's and Women's Plus Modern Midi Sleepwear Dress,14.97,4.8,252.0,omg in love with this brand and material i am obsessed comfortable and cozy item very comfortable night gown nice soft comfortable i like them super cute pockets wearing it most comfortable nite gown ever love it soft and comfy value good value for the price perfect sleep chemise i m obsessed wow it has pockets best clothing purchase from walmart in a long time,this sleepwear dress is the best love everything about it i just bought one more for my self very comfortable to sleep in looks very nice on love the fit i did get a size larger that i normally wear because i did get a size larger that i normally wear because i like to be comfortable when i sleep this material is so soft and feels like a dream on my skin the gown is do much more attractive than shown in the picture here i love this brand love these gowns i ve recieved 2 from my daughter while in hospital loved them so much that i ordered 3 more in different designs once i got home you won t be sorry these are legit the best item in the world i m pretty sure i have one in every pattern now lol they re so soft and comfortable and are my go to for around the house i ve even caught myself wearing them with a light sweater out and about like a dress i ordered one and loved it so much that i purchased two more in the other pattern this is very soft and comfortable for lounging around the house or using as sleepwear ni am 5ft and this comes to the length on my legs as pictured in the photo description i usually take a size medium but i ordered the small and it fits perfectly i do suggest sizing down it is still nice and roomy i have washed and hung to dry and no weird fuzzy pills showed up this garment is made very well hope this review helps you decide love this gown because of the soft fabric fit and style definitely roomy and might even run large i ordered 2 more gowns that were similar but a different maker and they run even larger i am a size 16 18 and the xl arm holes are very large i could have used a plain large looks better than in the photo shown the fabric is so lite and comfortable against your skin almost sexy this is one of my favorite gowns i wouldn t think twice about wearing it with a light jacket or sweater to run errands or to the mailbox i already wore it to my neighbors house she complimented me how nice my new dress was and where she could buy one i plan on buying more like this i would reccomend this gown to anyone looking for a comfortable attractive gown true to size when i made the purchase i wasn t sure if this was more nightgown or something i could wear to a meeting definitely more nightgown house dress beach cover up but it wouldn t be out of place if i threw a jacket on to go for a walk or to the store colors are nice it is longer than i expected but i think i also could have worn a size smaller so that s probably why which means it runs a little larger than the size chart says because the size i ordered should have been borderline too small and instead it is definitely too big by a size very stretchy except at armbands and neck it is less so they are generously cut though it s not a thrilling dress the detail on the front looks more weird than fetching but all in all i am glad i purchased it i put it on immediately and would be happy being able to wear such a dress all day and night most days so if i get a chance i ll order at least one more i m 5 4 and i bought the size i usually buy fits perfectly and the length is almost to my ankles i like the fabric and quality and will probably purchase several more super cute and soft runs a little big so order a size down but it doesn t matter for around the house this could be worn with a little kimono jacket to the store or errands easily here in the southwest it s a great piece for the price very pretty vivid colors soft material and has pockets my only issue is it s a tad see through up top which is why 4 stars instead of 5 i bought it to wear at the hospital after surgery but that makes it a no go for that but i m sure it ll be a favorite to wear at home this is the most comfortable sleep dress i wear it as a lounging dress the material feels really good i went back and bought a few more for family members i love the pockets too my daughter wore hers with a beautiful belt to the grocery store this is the best nite gown i have ever had soft and very comfortable i purchased 1 and loved it so much i purchased 3 more please don t stop making these i went to buy more and they are out of stock love this so soft and comfortable and love the pattern the only thing they could do differently is the white piping trim that separates the black bottom part should be black super soft and comfortable easy to care for i just tossed it in with my t shirts and washed on tap cold tumble dry low worn it about half a dozen times now and it looks and feels great good value absolutely love these gowns i get hot flashes through the night and these are cool to my skin i bought 4 and got one for my mom they no longer have them in my area but will buy some online if i find them highly recommend them comfy fits as expected the v neck is appropriate for modesty the arm holes are a little low so half of your bra band shows it does have pockets but you won t want to put anything but a tissue in them because the fabric is stretchy and bouncey jersey fabric i m pleased overall and glad i made the purchase i absolutely love this chemise gown the material is soft and cool perfect for warm summer nights i bought two more leopard print and stripes at my local walmart because one is not enough and the chemise has pockets which are always handy fits true to size have laundered several times and fabric looks brand new highly recommend ever since i discovered these last summer i ve been on the lookout for more they re soft flowy and comfy my favorite part is that they have large pockets that lay nicely so long as they re washed in cold on gentle and dried on low they ll last a long time although it fits much bigger to size i got a large and a small the small still fits with room to spare but i love the color softness length and it has pockets yeah i can now cook and keep my phone or other essentials in my pocket while cooking this is so comfortable and although it s a polyester type fabric it isn t hot at all and if i say it s not hot then it s not hot lol so soft and doesn t get bunched up while sleeping even has pockets for those days you don t want to get dressed great for a swimsuit cover up or for putting on after getting out of the hot tub i bought 4 of these after trying the first one fits true to size,women's clothing,1
491,"Smart & Sexy Womens Maximum Cleavage Bra, Style SA276",11.33,3.9,602.0,amazing my favorite bra great bra for the money true push up extra coverage disappointed cute bra but amazing bra highly recommend especially if you love push up amazing it is indeed maximum cleavage doesn t work for small breasts awful its a win for me but padding excessive,i received the one covered in lace it fits great makes my chest area appear fuller and gives lots of support i ve bought one of these in almost every color the only bra i ve found that actually holds up just as nice as the more expensive bras in the big name boutique stores love this bra so much cleavage in this bra and extra padding looks great in form fitting tops i ve been wearing this brand for years definitely makes you feel sexy great price too my favorite i cant believe they don t sell them in my store anymore but i ll just keep ordering them offline they are super comfy and amazing and dont send me into a fibromyalgia flare up like alot of others i bought 2 of these and they are very good quality for the price in the past i would spend 30 40 on one bra but not any more true to size and as comfortable as a bra can be my breast look amazing in these i have no shame to say i bought 4 more ni may not be always wearing one but when i do i look and feel great looks very nice but this is best for someone that needs a big lift i dont so it makes me look a bit too big i just wanted something that looked nice but wished i had more closely read the reviews dont get this unless you really need to push them up a lot or just dont have any if thats your problem go for it it will do the job thsi is otherwise a great color and comfortable bra unfortunately i will only be wearing this at home it definitely has the padding for adding a cup but expect it to cover more than your normal bra bought a c cup and it looked and felt more like a d covered my girls completely can t even wear a v neck with it oh my gosh i did not realize what i was getting when i ordered thus on line it was almost obscene lol it was huge and had so much padding that it definitely doubled my size i was looking for a little cleavage but not to multiply my size i returned it this is not the bra for you if you actually have boobs literally has full boobs built in it s not a lift or push up it s completely full of padding with no room for actual boobs to fit in it looked extremely unnatural i laughed so hard my side profile was hilarious the bra padding is so extreme it lifted my boobs up for cleavage like described but missed i was going to have 2 madonna looking sticking straight out boobs lol i returned it cute bra though omg this is the cutest and sexiest bra i have ever purchased from anyone it fits amazing and really makes my girls pop you can see the texture under certain shirts but thats expected from a textured bra it s ultra comfy love love love this bra it is my new favorite love the material and feel of it it looks sexy and i got a c 42 because i m pregnant and got fat so i needed a bigger size to feel comfortable and it feels amazing love it highly recommend oh and remember this is extra extra push up so if you have bigger boobs i would recommend a size up maybe lol i seen someone said if you have real actual big boobs on here not to get it but i think you should it s extra support just go a size bigger like i said maybe and it will probably fit absolutely amazing i don t really need a lot of help in the boob department but wow i m way satisfied with my purchase n ni m a fit and curvy medium large frame female about 5 8 200lbs sturdy sorta woman i got a 40 c which is true to my size and it definitely fits perfectly with a lot of breathing room very stretchy breathable material and again i don t really need the extra padding but it does help me to feel sexier my bust look bigger and fuller definitely at least 2 cup sizes and i love it it delivers what it promises it has a lot of padding i have 34b boobs and it makes it look like ddd the cleavage looks amazing if u already have big boobs i dont recommend it and if u have no boobs at all it will look very fake but if u have some boobs the padding will lift them up making it look like they are much bigger and perkier this bra fits horribly if i wear a tight enough dress or shirt it will hold it to my body in a way that makes it work but most of the time it stands away from my body awkwardly even though i got my usual size 34a i have tried adjusting the straps hooks etc and it just seems like it was designed for someone with breasts that are either much bigger or much rounder than mine this bra is ridiculous biggest waste of money i look like dolly parton on steroids completely unnatural and embarrassing looking i would not even wear this bra in private thats how ridiculous it is the padding is probably 3 inches thick no one needs that much padding not the most comfortable bra but it makes my breasts look bigger and thats what i bought it for so its a win for me no bra is 100 comfortable the lace band is a little scratchy the bra tends to ride up throughout the day and the straps fall but i have that issue with all bras n nthis particular bra has extra padding that adds about one cup size to breasts and also has a bit of push up effect i m normally an a cup but am a b cup appearance when wearing this i finally have a cleavage and honestly it has boosted my confidence incredibly n nif you have a smaller chest size and are looking for an enhancement this bra may be for you these extra padded bras are a bit hard to find now i m a c cup and it made me look like i was bigger than double d i didnt realize push up bras were literally all pad my mistake they were cute though loved the pink bra but it was so huge fits me perfect but the padding is too much makes me look like 4x bigger size up on bra a lot of padding very obvious a big bra i wanted something less oadding and more push up this definitely is more push up and more padding,women's clothing,0
492,"Just My Size Women's Satin Stretch Wireless Bra, Style MJ1960",13.46,4.3,2288.0,best fit for me great everyday bra comfy support very pleased reason for 4 stars good buy definitely would not recommend eh should ve skipped it way too small what a disappointment unfortunately underwhelmed no bones nice materials satin stretch wirefree bras not satisfied good product good sale price i bit uncomfortable roll at the waist th best bra i ve ever bought fits fine,this bra is comfortable and pretty most importantly it s the only style bra that fits me well i had a breast lift and reduction after losing 200 pounds whatever size the surgeon gave me nothing i tried on would fit finally i found this bra i ve been wearing this bra since 2003 my go to bra i ve ordered this bra many times over the years i love the stretchable cups and the thick band under the arms holds everything in the right place supportive and comfortable i know some women think that you need to have wires to have adequate support but that s just not true with the right construction i have worn the same style since high school and when my local store stopped carrying it i was upset until i found it on line where its cheaper definitely a win win for me have been purchasing this bra for many years have it only 4 stars because the color is now limited to white for my size company is moving backwards instead of forwards and that s a shame i really was happy with this purchase first off it s comfortable doesn t have underwire if you are looking for that gives you major lift don t buy this bra i paid for expensive bras because i m a big lady but i hate them so uncomfortable nthis was perfect good coverage didn t sag very thin material but will buy more i ordered the size that the accompanying size guide specified for me it was a 40 d i wondered if that could be correct since i haven t worn that small a cup size since i was 17 however foolish me i ordered what was specified wrong n nthis bra was waaaaay too small in the cup the band cut into me so badly i couldn t keep it on for very long and the straps are horribly uncomfortable nothing in this bra stretched as advertised n nnot only is it not just my size but it is also rather cheaply made and uncomfortable i know i ve n nsaid that already but can t stress it enough uncomfortable n ni would not recommend buying this bra i just want a comfortable bra with good support i feel like i ve bought them all i mean it s alright if you re cool with cone boobs and visible nipple through your shirt my boobs look far apart and pointed outwards i don t get why wireless bras can t at least have more over top boob coverage just enough to shape them some and hide my nipples the sizing is accurate the leopard print drew me in it is cute to look at just not on i won t leave the house in it sadly the sizing was nowhere near accurate i ordered two of another brand in the same size and they fit perfectly the jms were seriously too small trying to decide if it s worth the trouble returning them i won t order any more of their brand that s for sure i barely had it on an hour n the whole inseam on the right cup came out so my breast was just hanging there thank god i was at home when it happened i feel bad i had great hopes and was rather underwhelmed the seaming bit into my side at one point under my arm just on the right side not the left i checked and the way the stitching and fold is done there is a definite rough spot the seam down the front is sewn in such a way that it sticks out beyond the body within the cup and pokes out of my shirt in a very obvious and embarrassing fashion my husband jokingly suggested i was doing a madonna impersonation the shoulder straps are great wide enough to give good support without cutting into the skin the size runs true for the aoubd the body measurement and cup size except for the awkward seam i did try adjusting it and tugging to flatten and it would for a little while and then it was back i finally wore it with a huge dark tee shirt simply because i didn t want to relegate it to the back of the drawer never to be seen again i usually shop the competition but was getting frustrated with the prices i still think they are high but given the amount of wear i get from them i may have to bite the bullet i am going to try some other bra styles here and see if i can find something else first tho the bra fits just the way i like also they last a long time keeps shape these are nice bras but the only thing find off about them is the size of the cup is a bit off i have been a c for over 50 years and the last couple of orders they ve been off i have found that garments made in different countries have a different ways of sizing for example our country a garment would be a 16 18 but a 12 from a different country these not having cotton in them won t adjust the size it s the top of the cup that s off been wearing these for years and love them sometimes though the straps have rough edges that cause chafing and sores just an fyi i have been wearing this bra for over 20 years yes 20 years last year jms started constructing it differently so not satisfied they fit very well and the price is right i am used to something with a bit more padding for the fit makes up for it this bra fits very well for the full figure however the bottom waist part rolls and becomes uncomfortable i guess the wire is needed after all if you re smaller in the cups this might be your fit the only brand i ve found that makes my size with other brands most the time the band size is huge for my cup size or the straps won t go to a usable size too big or too stretchy but this brand works good i absolutely love this bra and this style it is the only one i will wear i am so

496,The Cozy Corner Women's Long Sleeve Sherpa Top & Multi Color Fleece Plush Bottom Pajama Set,12.99,3.7,17.0,sherpa top camouflage bottom pajama set really cute set cozy great for winter nights cosy pajama set very soft fabulous but didn t love this super soft fleece pjs very soft this pajama runs very small lounging in comfort,the first word that came to mind when i took this pj set out of the bag soft very soft it seems to be well made the top is much too pretty to keep for sleeping it would make a great top over velour pants which is what i intend to do the top measurements as measured with the top laying flat bust 18 5 hip 19 25 center back to end of cuff 31 5 back length 26 the bottom is not straight across but has a nice curve the pants as laying flat hip 22 inseam 29 25 back crotch depth 14 overall length at side seam including cuff 39 there is a dark blue ribbon tie at the waist for decorative purposes only it s not a drawstring i m only 5 1 and the pants came to my ankles for someone with long legs the bottoms would be too short i washed and dried the set and all seams stayed intact the bottoms are pink dark blue avocado green and ivory the sherpa top is all ivory this would make a comfy lounging set i ll probably get a sweatshirt to pair with the bottoms as i said keep the top to wear like a sweater since i got the pj set in june it s way too hot to wear it i ll know about it when the weather turns colder i tried it on a few times and it seems very comfortable this pajama set is just what i have been looking for the top is fleece and very soft the bottoms are soft and are a pale blue camouflage really cute set oh these pajamas are so cozy and comfy the colors and plaid design are so cute these pajamas will definitely keep you all snuggly and warm during the chilly temperatures the pajama top is a long sleeve top i don t usually prefer to sleep in long sleeves but these are nice and are comfortable enough in the underarm area to be comfortable to sleep in love these what a great set for winter nights the top is fluffy and soft the bottoms are a pink blue camouflage color these are lovely for winter really cosy look and soft to the feel the colors are very nice and make you feel feminine and cosy for those cold fl morning and evenings in winter when you want to feel snuggled these fit the bill very loose and comfortable on which are great to sleep with love the colors and the design nice and soft for a cold night the bottom are a different material then the top i would have preferred the top be the same as the bottom but it s ok love the color and the plaid love the softness of both fabrics love the sale price i wouldn t hesitate to order all colors except the top fits so closely and shows every tummy muffin top and back bulge it s downright unattractive i ve never had a fleecy top that did that if i order a larger size the bottoms will most likely be too large sending it back so disappointed go up a size or two if you like fitted up one size if you like a little bigger pajamas go up toe sizes i had to exchange for larger sizes i didn t love this set the bottoms were okay the fit was as expected and they are made of soft 100 polyester fleecy feel but not completely they are thin so not too hot i would not necessarily call the pattern that i received tie dye it s blue splotches like camo more than tie dye the biggest issue i had with them is that they actually have little cuffs at the bottom which is more like a child s pajama set than anything i ve ever had as an adult it was a little hard to get used to the top was absolutely not what i was expecting it s also 100 polyester but it is as poofy as a cloud i ve had blankets like this before but this was a full on sweater my first impression after putting it on is that it would have been a lot cozier if it were bigger it s not long at all and was a big snug not as true to size as the pants with some more room to move i might have enjoyed it better i also know from experience that this type of super soft cushy fabric hangs really easily on everything so i think anyone with any dry skin issues would be absolutely miserable wearing this it will hang up and scrape any dry skin on your hands and upper body i attached a picture of the inside of the shirt it s not quite as poofy inside but has a lot of the same feel the shirt also has the cuff on the end of the sleeves keeping it tighter to your wrists without any flow all in all with the size and features i did not feel cozy i felt a little like i was trapped i also fully admit that i have not tried to wash it as i have a strong feeling this top is going to shed this poofy stuff all over my washer and dryer i can t really recommend this set wanted to love but fit is weird shoulders are tight and the front of the bottoms is higher than the back so comfy and warm but runs small should of gotten it in a medium still and all perfect for cool fall weather very nice for a cold night this pajama runs very small i ordered xl but it fits my daughter who is medium material was not what was expected did not like the fit i am planning to return it the top is fluffy and soft the set is good for sleeping and lounging around,women's clothing,0

stars if i could see photo great tanks more colors please great tank top hanes x temp women s performance tank cool cute fun depends uncomfortable non sporty material womens performance tank tops great tanks quarantine buy that s worth it,soft durable tank top they look great i love these tank tops i will say that they run a bit small fitted i normally wear a size small but ordered a medium just to make sure it wasn t tight it fits perfectly i also like the material of the tank and it does a good job of keeping me cool it doesn t have that annoying slinky sweat slinking material it feels more like cotton which i prefer nice mid weight tank great for exercising in the texas summer the armholes are just right not too tight and not gaping i ve washed and hung to dry several times and it has held up well it says tagless but i bought 4 different colors and all had tags i m tall and slim and the medium fits well so much cooler with this top soft and comfy wear size 12 reg large fits perfect top has a nice flow to it have red and blue and like the colors true to what is shown great material and very comfortable size 2x shown this is a comfortable tank top from hanes for women i buy these a lot wish these had the little pocket on it like the others i bought a couple years ago from walmart com but couldnt find any oh well they are the same material and comfy i would recommend it i don t care for this tank as much as the scoop neck ones i wear it doesn t fit me the same it is ok just not my favorite i m older so that may be part of the reason very nice soft material which is opaque enough the hemline is as illustrated however the straps aren t even close if that doesn t bother you then you may like them the pink is much more vibrant than the dusty rose color i see on my screen the white is a true bright white the stitching came off after the first wash see photo the color of the tank is different but it is the very same product also finding clothes that aren t hair magnets is always a challenge well the material of this tank is very scratchy btw i have a high quality washer the stitching came off after the first wash see photo also finding clothes that aren t hair magnets is always a challenge well the material of this tank is very scratchy btw i have a high quality washer this shirt is really nice material but fit me kinda weird if you are big chested this prob wont work for you love these tanks they fit well they are not too tight on my belly they wash well they are very comfortable i wish they came in more colors i like to buy 1 size up so they aren t too tight these tank tops are great they are slightly fitted and the hemline is shaped to be longer in front and back for more contemporary styling they are great with all my shorts leggings and skirts i usually wear a small which is what i ordered and it s perfect i loved this top so much that after i received my first order i ordered every color available i love the tank tops but the gray top was very thin cotton the others were made of different material with a lil polyester and cotton mixed i am enjoying wearing them though even though i was a lil disappointed in one of them it still wears well i washed the gray one in warm water i should have went cold all the way it shrunk a lil i purchased this sleeveless top in red blue they fit true to size are comfortable the material is substantial i machine washed them hung to dry they did up well i realized when i was hanging them to dry it indicates not to use fabric softener which i did but won t next time i don t know why nbut will follow instructions next time read them first it s definitely a style for women due to the rounded cut of the bottom of the tank it s really cute but it runs small i ve never ever worn the next size up so i just didn t put it in the dryer after washing also i d better not gain any weight or it will just be too tight over the boobs the material is extremely thin which for hot weather walking is great and probably explains the cute fit but it s the thinnest cotton shirt i ve ever seen runs small especially the chest area is in no way a sport like tank the material is heavy and not stretchy it took hanes forever to actually ship so i ll just donate them rather than try to return but i now know better than to order anything based on their descriptions i ordered 3 of these tops the colors are great but they run a little small i ordered size large which i usually have a little wiggle room in these tops are tight for a large i will keep them in hopes of losing a little weight for the summer quality is very good i was looking for some inexpensive tanks to wear around the house this summer and these fit the bill i bought several in various colors i deliberately ordered up thinking they would shrink after washing which they did but only very slightly so i d say if you re solidly a certain size or like a slimmer fit stay with your regular size the only complaint i could make is they would be better if they were tagless a bit shorter than anticipated but still really cute to wear to the store or work out in,women's clothing,0

comfy this review was collected as part of a promotion ordered an xl and its pretty comfortable love how soft it is its a little snug under the bust so it might run a little small is suggest going up a size i did take out the cups because they didnt fit in there the right way would buy again but one size up bra is soft but looks like they cut it out and forgot to finish sewing it look very closely at the picture luckily i didn t wear it out of the house because boobs would fall out from the bottom the padding rolled up i used their sizing chart and bought the recommended size i do not recommend this bra love this bra i like how the fabric is breathable and soft to the touch i wish the band was slightly tighter around the rib cage region but it has transitioned to my new bra for my 12 hour shifts at the hospital highly recommend this review was collected as part of a promotion i really loved the material of this bra the straps were super comfortable for me this purple color was super cute i could even wear a white t shirt with it the little padding is just perfect for something to wear around the house i would definitely recommend this review was collected as part of a promotion

m definitely going to use it a lot this review was collected as part of a promotion i have never wore a bra wire free before influenter gifted me with this fabulous bra from the hanes brand i feel very comfortable and safe i can say that it is as if i was without a bra but i like my breasts in a correct posture and without wires this review was collected as part of a promotion it is a really soft cooling material i really liked how it feels and how comfortable it is to wear it the only thing i did not like while wearing it is that the padding folds very easily there isnt a lot of support either it has a sports bra type of feel to it this review was collected as part of a promotion a bra i can actually wear all day without counting the minutes until i can take it off the fabric feels really nice against my skin no weird rubbing or bunching i love the steel grey color such a pretty neutral the price point is great theyre about 1 3 of the price of similar styles from other brands im able to breastfeed in this bra really easily which is a huge plus the cups pull down for easy access without getting stretched out or losing shape on the neckline i do wish i would have sized down i purchased a large based on the size chart 38c for reference and because of the stretch in the fabric it not quite as supportive as i was hoping ill wear this one around the house and buy a medium next time i also was hoping the cups would have been molded into the bra and not removable they sometimes bunch up after im done nursing and theyre just annoying to deal with washing a minor inconvenience but its whats keeping it from a 5 star rating for me overall im really impressed with this bra and will purchase at least one more this review was collected as part of a promotion it s light and comfy to wear the quality is good been wearing this for about a week now wash 2 times and so far the quality still excellent the price is very affordable amd would thinking to buy another color soon this

520,5-Pack Fleece Lined Leggings for Women Winter Warm Thermal Full Length Leggings,32.95,4.2,173.0,better than long johns a very good buy i love them good company i was surprised how great these were super comfy great price the modern replacement for long underwear good value overall disappointed smells heavily like kerosene fear toxic heavy kerosene smell soft okay soft hold their shape and comfy,i threw away all my others long john s for these yes i know they are made for women but after trying them there is no comparison much softer and warmer they hug you much better than long john s that hug makes them warmer because they stay against your skin i love love the softness and how it hugs my legs i am a size medium and these leggings fit perfectly and gives the ultimate support for hours as soon as i received my order i wore one to run errands and my hubby could hardly keep his eyes off me so when i got back home i immediately placed another order and now i have all the colors yeah i love how soft they are they fit really good my only thing is that my black pair was a little bit bigger then all the other ones and the waste was higher too but i still give a 5 these are wonderful i m impressed with how warm and cozy these are they are thinner than i expected so i was shocked with how well they kept me warm i wore them around the house out to run errands and then under jeans to walk my dog tonight they are awesomely cute and versatile not only will i reccomend them to people i ll be ordering all the different colors keeps the legs nice and warm very comfy got the plus size and fits me perfectly only bad thing is i was missing the grey ones but they did send me a replacement i just loved them i m very thin and their great to wear under my jeans i also love the one size fits all i also love the softness of the materials thank you i was hesitant to order because the price was the same as what i spent for 2 pair at hsn getting 5 pair i figured they wouldnt be as high quality boy was i wrong just as warm just as soft and they look and fit great these are super soft warm and very comfy i wear these instead of tights under a dress or as pants with a top these are also easy to care for great bargain these leggings are very soft and the fleece is great but they are a one size fits all yeah they fit but i always feel like the crotch is about mid thigh and i wear a size 8 10 also i wouldn t wear them out in public without a top that would go to mid thigh they show everything very form fitting i liked the price color selection and how the leggings are made i ordered a larger size than normal hopping the length would fit longer for wearing in cooler weather but all fit slightly above the ankle they also had a metallic oil smell out of the package and still a faint smell after washing they did was well and no shrinking i love these they are soft stretchy comfortable and warm the inside is fuzzy fleece for warmth the outside is slick so you could slide jeans or pants over them for extra warmth basically good value for the price i am 5 4 and 235 may need to wear underwear to keep them from slipping down will see but good for under skirts or long sweater note material is thin so just beware i am an xl and ordered the plus size in these leggings of the 5 pair i can only wear 2 the other 3 pair are another brand and i can barely get them on and i am at the lower end of the plus size scale very disappointing because the ones that actually fit are really nice i wore the grey ones very comfy then i wore the cranberry ones and i noticed they have a small hole in 2 spots on thigh area i dont want to return so i might purposely make a couple cuts to make them look like they are supposed to be that way these tights have a heavy kerosene smell i cannot get the smell out that was a waste of 28 00 i m scared to wear them i fear they are toxic i have washed them 10 times used both vinegar and baking soda separately i left them hanging outside for a week during rainy days thinking natural ozone might clear the smell nope can t get the kerosene smell out i suggest you do not purchase these they have a very heavy kerosene smell i can t get out i m scared to wear them as i fear they are toxic i have tried washing them 10 times with baking soda and vinegar separately i left them hanging outside for a week nothing gets this smell out waste of 28 00 i absolutely love these leggings the material is so soft and comfortable they are true to size and fit great a great price for such a good quality product these are very thin and using the phrase fleece lined is deceptive i didn t perceive any lining the material balls quickly and becomes very unattractive 2 of the 5 pack were not kuda moda brand n2 were a different brand an those 2 came with no tags at all ncolors do look like in the picture ni haven t washed them yet hopefully they will wash okay love these i m about a size 8 10 and took a chance on the small

warm extremely form fitting tricky to get on great quality comfy but run very small sizing is way off love this product they fit technically might want to order one size bigger fleece leggings 2 pack these run very very very very small very disappointed toasty good purchase,thank goodness leggings has come back in style i love wearing leggings that is most of my pants in my closet because i wear leggings so much i have become quite picky with the materials leggings i wear has to be soft cannot be see through for the summer ones can t be too hot when i wear them and for winter ones has to be able to keep me warm i am trying out the women s plus size high waisted 2 pack fleece lined athleisure leggings first thing i noticed is that it is pretty thick which means i probably cannot wear it during the summer seasons but seems perfect for winter weather it also feels really soft it is lined with fleece which is probably why it is so soft i am sure the thickness and softness will keep me warm and comfortable during the winter months another thing i really like is the quality of the material i was able to really stretch the material but it still cannot see through i posted a photo of the pants really stretched out to show the quality of it i tried it out and no doubt it was really soft stretchy comfortable and kept me really warm i like that it is plain black so i can match with pretty much any color top it works well with most occasions depending on the top i match it with which makes it so versatile these are the best leggings ever especially for cold days they are thick and very very comfortable i really like the high waisted style because of my stomach area i usually wear a large in leggings and these are 1x 2x and they fit perfectly i assume they run somewhat small which is ok by me i will be buying these leggings i wear a size 22 24 so i ordered the 3x they do fit however you have to put them on like pantyhose with the amount of compression these things have they are warm enough for a texas winter so far they do show every curve and bump and are great at sucking in the tummy some too yes i fit that stay at home mom stereotype i live in leggings with two small children i am busy all day every day these are so easy to throw on and do house work or school drop off pick up for my oldest they also work for running errands i also try to go running when i can arrange for someone to watch the baby these are great for running in the chilly fall weather they are so warm and so comfy they are also flattering to a mom with some extra baby weight still hanging around i pair them with my favorite fall cardigan and they are perfect also great for wearing under dresses in cool weather i think they are mostly true to size but i would size up if in doubt definitely recommend and i will be getting more they are a staple for me these leggings are so comfortable with leggings they come in different textures these leggings are lined making it comfortable to wear during the cold winter days these leggings don t itch and they feel amazing i would definitely recommend these leggings so i was pretty excited about these pants i am all about high waisted pants and like that i can also turn down the extra tall part of the pants if i want to i was very curious about the fleece lined and how exactly that would work with leggings but they are athleisure so i went with it i was pleasantly surprised in that they were not fleece lined as i was thinking they might be i thought there might be fuzzy type material inside that would make them super thick i think my other leggings are much thinner but not so much that these were too thick they were like one more layer of super thick tights definitely thicker than most leggings but not so thick you would feel like you are wearing pajama pants and of course the value is amazing and two packs are always amazing i strongly suggest you err on the side of getting a bigger size they most certainly run a little small size wise in fact the drawbacks or negatives for these leggings were that they are a little hard to get on due to the thickness again think of very thick tights and they were not roomy enough for me in the seat everywhere else was fine thighs lower legs tummy but the bum was a little too tight for me i do like these but do suggest ordering on the bigger side for your size i was a little concerned that these fleece leggings would not fit me despite getting the correct size although they were rather tricky to get them precisely placed once they were on they are extremely comfortable to explain what i mean the groin region was the area i had problems with it was almost like trying to get into a really tight fitting pair of jeans but in order to not have a lot of unflattering space between my groin and thighs it did require a bit of wiggling and pulling to get these leggings where they needed to be these are extremely form fitting leggings so i know that i will only be wearing these around the house or under clothing i honestly feel like these would be the perfect leggings to wear under clothing to join the kids outside in the snow this winter i love the high waist which measures approximately 3 inches also i love the fact that these come with 2 in a pack and the colors look phenomenal unlike some other legging brands i ve bought in the past these leggings are not see through and revealing although i would not feel comfortable enough going shopping with these on i feel like they are perfect for a relaxing day at home and i would easily wear these outside to walk the dog or to grab the mail etc i love how soft and warm these leggings are and they seem to wash well and are holding up nicely so far overall i would recommend these to anyone that stays cold like myself i think these would be perfect to wear under clothing to help keep you warm on the colder days i would recommend these to others but keep in mind they can be tricky to get on and are a little to tight for this mom of 4 to feel comfortable wearing out in public these leggings are really great quality i love the thickness of them theres 2 leggings in the pack mine had one grey one black they are 95 polyester and 5 spandex after washing and drying them they showed no signs of wear and still looked like new the only problem i have is the size run small it says the size is 2x 3x but its not its probably a large other than that these are very well made high quality leggings and i would definitely recommend them in the right size the thickness and quality is really amazing i received these women s plus size high waisted 2 pack fleece lined athleisure leggings i have to start by saying how extremely soft and comfy these are i also love the high waisted thick band at the top i wear these with the waist band folded down like yoga pants the fleece lining is so soft and comfy against my skin and so soooo warm these will be a favorite this winter for me the length is great but the sizing runs very small compared to most other brands i usually wear a size med large or a sz 12 in pants leggings these fit perfectly and these are sized at a 2x 3x there s a huge difference in sizing i don t mind but anyone who is looking for a size true to a 2x 3x would be very disappointed because these run so small overall i would recommend these but would really suggest double checking on size i recently received the women s plus size high waisted 2 pack fleece lined athleisure leggings in the 2x 3x size i picked these leggings specifically for my mom because she has recently decided to start walking in the mornings with me as soon as i took these leggings out of the packaging i thought there was no way these leggings would fit my mom i usually wear a size small medium in leggings so i tried this 2x 3x sized legging on and it fit me perfectly i didn t want to embarrass my mom by having her try these on and them not fitting so i asked my husband who wears a 38 x 29 size pants and they fit him pretty tight i do have to admit that he was able to get them on and off but it wasn t really that comfortable i do give these leggings extra points for being able to fit different sized bodies but that is a wide range of sizes to cover i m kind of interested to see how the size small medium would fit me now i did like the really high 3 inch waist because it really holds in that mama pouch that a lot of us women have the fleece lining on the inside was super soft and really warm and just all around felt great in the chilly weather i also love the fact that these leggings come in a two pack these leggings are great they are soft and fit true to size they have a large band of material that is high waisted to help with tummy bulge what i really like about them is that they are long enough to reach the top of my tennis shoes they are very warm and they fit great the 2xl are very snug but i will wear them i was surprised to see that there was no seams in back or front and on sides i would have rather had scenes in the front and back that s why i give it a four but yes i would buy again if they had different colors would like a pair of hunter green i am 5 8 300 lbs i wear a 20 22 in pants and got the 2x 3x i can put them on and they stay on but it takes some finagling to get them on and they fit weird in the crotch they are comfortable and thick and i will still wear them but won t order more also love that they are actually high waist even with my belly in the way run on the small size in fact i didn t think they would fit they did but i had to work at getting them on i already know that i better not put in dryer they are warm and fit like a second skin bought a size larger than i normally wear and i couldn t even get these up my legs i have already returned them they are not the kind of leggings i was expecting i ordered my normal plus size 2x 3x these are described as plus size they look like they might fit someone who wears a normal size medium or large frustrating and a waste of money the size was misrepresented they are much smaller than a 2x 3x ever worse they stink and washing didnt get rid of the smell it is like machine oil or something chemical and i will probably send them back the material was very nice that layer of warmth will be appreciated in cooler weather size wise great for a 2x could be tricky for a 3x especially if you re ample in the thigh area these are perfect for this time of year when it s cold outside and you want to want a dress or a skirt i purchased these for my sister who loves them she states they are warm soft and comfortable she plans to buy more,women's clothing,0

526,Hanes Women's X-Temp w/ Fresh IQ Short Sleeve Pique Polo Shirt,10.15,3.7,346.0,work attire my new manger told me that wal mart has shirts hunter green polo quality polo shirts for women great polo great price short sleeves shown longer white not white off white color its a no for me satisfied shopper it ll do i love it so much that i ordered four more run small great top size was way smaller than stated donated women s polo shirts nice lightweight polo,medium is kind of snug but it s perfect for work i ll be ordering large ones for work i m 5 3 and 135 lbs hello my name is anita glorioso love the shirt brought for job hopefully of getting just had hysterectory in june 5 my doctor said it ok to get back to work ready to get back to work can start august 28 put in application in at dollar tree had my interview so glad you had a new green shirt i have to wear a green collated shirt for work and this is perfect fabric is soft and washes up great i usually wear a medium but the other reviews recommend going up a size and the fit is good this is the second time i have ordered this same one and will do so again when i need more bought 3 different brands of polo shirts for work and although i like them all i do have comments for each n nhanes is my favorite because it is the perfect length and does not expose my belly when i reach above my head also the thread used to sew the buttons on is the same color as the shirt which might seem petty but makes a difference to me n nlee came in second only because it s a bit shorter than the hanes and therefore shows some skin when i reach above my head the material is very soft however and i do like the more feminine cut n njerzees is my least favorite of the three because it s not as soft and i don t like the white thread and white buttons on my otherwise dark purple shirt that being said it s worth the price quality was good but xl fit like a lg so i gave mine to a friend i didnt bother returning them but im sure they would of gave a refund or exchange without any problem shipping was very quick the shirts were cut a tiny bit smaller than i was expecting from comparison places but i was still able to wear the shirts i ordered this review was collected as part of a promotion fits like a dream and washes very well my only complaint is that the fabric isn t particularly soft it s pretty standard polo shirt fabric i guess but i think it ll get softer with every wash that said the fit is better than most other polos out there and the price is unbeatable short sleeves the photo show them mid shoulder elbow they re not regular short sleeves they are good quality for the price tho the quality is good however the white was not white it is more of a off white color and that was disappointing i used to buy the no boundaries brand polo shirts from walmart they were amazing soft quality material and came in a ton of beautiful colors i am so sad they are not providing these anymore none the less i still need polo shirts for work so i ordered this one to try its shorter than i like fits boxy and had a rough cheap looking material its a no for me i like it it doesn t get wet when i sweat i bought it to wear at work i had mine for two weeks and their is no sweat stains in the armpit area ni would recommend buying this i ll be ordering more was in a bind needing uniform shirts for my daughter i wish they had a more feminine cut design to them look like boy men s polos after reading all the size issues in the reviews i measured my daughter and then went up one size their too big so don t always let others reviews scare you like it did me i did have to get another color from another store because hanest didn t have it and the only comment my child has actually said is that the other stores polos are softer and more comfy but seriously can t beat the price hanes is selling theirs for i purchased this style polo to wear at work i was surprised how cool it kept me feeling while working in 100 degree weather it washes well and i hang it dry and i have not had to iron it after hanging dry i only ironed it once after removing it from shipping packaging after wearing and washing this item five times i m very impressed with the quality and easy care required i ve already purchased four more shirts in this same style great colors price but run very small returned them all i bought these for my niece to wear as work uniforms she was so happy because they were hard to find anywhere else i loved the price i have to wear this type of shirt for work i love the quality of the fabric and the fit is great i only wish that there where more colors to choose from i d buy more sizing is way smaller for a plus size donated the item would not order again coming from hanes i was way disappointed recently my job uniform has changed and we are allowed to wear polo shirts now solid color polo shirts so i ordered a few in different colors and i love them they wash easy and very comfortable i live in hawaii and i purchased these to use at work great lightweight fabric perfect for our climate i wish they had a chart listing the length of the shirt because i am only 4 11 135 lbs and the shirt is a little long on me i am large in the chest and ordered xl using their size chart other than the length the shirt was perfect maybe hanes could start a petite line i washed them in cold water on gentle and hung them to dry they faded endlessly they look worn out and used,women's clothing,0
527,Champion Women's Jersey Pants,11.0,4.0,538.0,great basic pants very nice i have 5 of these love them very comfortable great quality runs a little big good basic sweat pant my every day comfortable pants who wears heels with sweatpants disappointed champion used to be good not any more pour judgement very comfortable good purchase just wish they were softer not worth it super comfy add some related products request best lounge pants cotton jersey pants,love these pants order them every year because i wear them out i wear them in the house almost everyday cleaning the house running errands extremely comfortable wash well i am 5 6 they run a little long when brand new however eventually shrink after several washings i m very pleased with these pants they are comfortable and fit well cool for summer and easy to work in the elastic waists are particularly well made and durable nice too is that these pants wash easily and come clean love these sweat pants the black is 100 cotton grey is not and the grey pills black easy to wash no pilling comfortable and fit great they shrink but do stretch back out after wearing a bit long as i am 5 6 wear a small and still lightly touch the ground great quality very comfortable but they are very long i bought large i m 5 8 just too long but i m going to hem them happy overall would buy again although these were a very nice material and seemed like they d be really comfortable they were much bigger than i thought they d be since they re not tight around the ankle they were way too long for me i ordered a size xxl and i m only 5 2 so if you re built anything like me they ll be too big i think i may have been better with an xl but even then i feel like them may have been too long i gave them to my friend who is 5 7 and they fit her nicely perhaps even a little long on her but doable still if i had been taller these pants would have been amazing these replaced a previous exact pair i had for awhile that the crotch seam had begun to unravel these are a good basic sweat pant that wear well but that particular seam tends to tear either in the crotch or in the rear they would wear longer if this seam was reinforced these are my comfortable every day pants i work at home so don t need to dress up but i also wear them out to do errands i have the black ones which look dressier than the other colors and are better at hiding wrinkles black also goes with most of my tops they are a medium weight cotton which gives it some sturdiness and is comfortable most times of the year in california unless it s very hot or cold i love that they are cotton and have an elastic waist and are not too wide or too skinny in the legs that s hard to find they run a little big which i don t mind but i m 5 6 which is not short and these are way too long on me this is why i gave them 4 stars instead of 5 they should have a separate long length for pants these long i will have to hem them i have not washed them yet so don t know if they will shrink in the dryer i hope the length will shrink but nothing else i am reasonably tall 5 7 and to wear these sweatpants without tripping over the excessive length i would have to wear 4 heels who does that the cost of having them altered would have been greater than the cost of the pants the material was also very thin they were returned you are taking a chance with these pants i ordered 2 pairs both size small one black and one gray the black had elastic in the waist band fit was about a size too big and was a little long i am 125lbs and 5 7 but easy to hem the gray had no elastic in the waist band was way too big seemed bigger than a large but the length was ok the black is comfortable to wear around the house but i would not wear outside and i am not sure what i will do with the gray without a lot of sewing and alteration as other reviews said these pants are way too long even if i downsized to the old champion pants i used to know and love the material is super thin and like other reviews i can t imagine what would happen if washed wouldn t spend the time hemming them myself as others have done i have ordered this brand several times before but this time i ordered a different color which was the granite very poor material washed when i received them hung to dry put them on next day and there was a tear about 2 inches long poor quality material these pants are perfect for laid back days or exercise fit great nice material and plenty long priced right the pants fit well and seem to be to size as others have mentioned they are not nearly as soft as i hoped and the waistband might be bothersome if you like a softer material overall it is a comfy product just not quite soft enough these pants are sheer so watch what you wear under neath i had them for about a week washed once and the crotch area was coming apart they are long but shrank a little still long though just what i was looking for very comfortable they are longer than i thought they would be so that was a pleasant surprise if you re looking for a thinner type of sweatpant or lounge pant these are it theyre too long washed them thinking they would shrink some i need some sweats bad hang around in bought six pair and none fit right ive found i dont like ordering online nothing ever fits right it would be great to have something just like this but with pockets been buying these pants for awhile but always wish i had a place to put my cell phone i also made some of these into shorts for hiking good to have something cotton and cool and something like that is almost impossible to find super comfortable perfect weight not too thin and not too thick and finally lounge pants that are long enough to put in the dryer and not be too short i love these i really like the pants comfortable and a good length unfortunately after being worn and washed only a couple of times i had 2 small holes in the center seam i would still recommend the pants though,women's

good price but very disappointed no cotton in these socks at all not impressed with the socks product has changed not what i expected soft socks great socks wrong size great socks great value hanes

great but aren t the same as the picture shows instead of being solid white they have a gray heal and toe i had actually wanted the ones with the gray heal and toe but thought they were sold out so it worked out great i have both kinds at home and prefer the gray heal and toe because they have a little more cushion purchased these hanes ankle socks in the past and liked them now after lawn work season ended i needed some new socks for work and everything completed in comdort at home during the pandemic i am very happy i purchased these socks i had socks that would fall under my heel while

tight around the ankles and don t slide under my heel nothing more uncomfortable than that i highly recommended this product these socks are nice good quality not too thick and not too thin i purchased these for my pre teen daughter for everyday use and she likes them i have purchased socks of a different brand in the past and they get holes after one wash these have been washed several times already and are holding up nicely so far these socks are a good buy but they are a bit thinner than i expected the narrow cuff squeezes my ankle some which isn t good since i have some circulation problems i wish the cuff was wider and the body of the sock thicker they will be ok till i can get some better ones very poor quality thick like something from trash can that you can t imaging very disappointed really i bought the hanes brand products years in nv and had no problem then i moved it automatically links to the closest store near me which is in ca i don t know why it make so much different do not believe the material content information given when my package arrived there was a sticker on the back that says they are 97 polyester 2 spandex 1 other fibers does hanes not make any mostly cotton socks anymore these are going back to the store these are not the socks i thought not sure where all the cushion is the socks i used to get were actually cushioned and these seem to be pretty thin in comparison i definitely will not be wearing them to work while i am on my feet for ten hours a day i will keep them to wear on the weekends to lounge around in website said these were cotton mix and when i received them they had no cotton at all had to send them back please bring back cotton socks i am very pleased with my purchase of hanes ankle socks these socks are so comfortable and are the perfect thickness i am going to keep a supply of these socks on hand they are great for every season too i love these socks they fit great they don t squeeze my ankles too tightly like ankle socks they are thicker and more cushiony so i feel like they won t wear out as fast i will definitely buy them again i ordered these socks but were sent a size for little girls lol i will be returning asap my order sheet was correct but i was sent a size 5 9 i wear women s 9 12 these are really nice socks soft cool comfortable much better than similar hanes socks i bought a couple of years ago much nicer sock and much better value i won t wear any other brand of sock i love the feel of these socks they hold their shape and don t tend to stretch out like most other brand i ve tried in the past very soft cotton fabric was terribly disappointed in the quality of this product i thought i had found the perfect replacement for some hanes socks previously purchased and could no longer purchase locally but these are far inferior the fabric is much much thinner and one sock even had a hole in the heel they slide down into your shoe which is a total pain literally and figuratively do not recommend if you have a larger size 9 shoe foot i buy all the time great product comfortable low rise socks these are the real deal they are thick and comfey for my sensitive feet i have diabetes and the nerve endings in my feet are super sensitive sometimes so i need all the padding i can get so i can walk as much as i need to sometimes even though they say hands you can tell that they are not the real deal they are imposter s that s why i prefer to buy them straight from the hands company it s always a good buy and good quality,women's clothing,0

the hype these are really nice i use to work for american eagle s sister store aerie do i m all about leggings these are the softest compression leggings i ve ever tried the fit is nice i m between a large and a medium and i went with the medium i m 170 for reference definitely had to work them over my hips but the larger size would probably slide down after wearing for a few hours the material is soft and definitely squat proof they do run small though i usually buy a small for leggings but this one is snug and will need a medium love love love perfect with a nice price tag these are the best quality leggings i own and i have a ton i will forever be waiting for avia to make these in solid black they are the perfect thickness perfect material perfect compression 10 10 would recommend these

but they are very cute in real life they are so soft yet supportive i have to say that they feel better than most leggings i ve purchased at a much higher price point they aren t too hot but seem to have a thicker or double material so that they are not see through i am 5 9 and they were long enough which is something i rarely find final rave they have pockets can t go wrong with pockets avia really knocked this one out of the park great fitting athletic pants love the design as well saw them originally in the location closets to my house but they didn t have my size so i went and found them online at another store further away and drove to pick them up would definitely recommend these to anyone these feel really good the material is thick and comfortable the legs are perfect length i got a medium and i m 5 4 i have heard people compare these leggings as dupes for lululemon and i have to say the quality of these are definitely high end not what you would expect from lower priced walmart leggings highly recommend i really havent went wrong with avia leggings they have been my favorite but these are superior wish they came in more styles with this material wow i have been looking for striped black and white leggings for about a year now i had been eyeing some at lululemon but for 98 no thanks also gap has some similar for about 50 again no thanks n nthese leggings are just as good they are from a great material used them for squats and nothing was showing they are great and fit very well best leggings i own i wish they would use this same fabric across the entire brand so far this pattern is the only one with as high of quality if i could give more stars i would these are higher waisted medium compression and no fall down during strength training or running

540,Flexees Women's Maidenform Cool Comfort Firm Romper,16.94,4.5,233.0,this is the one keeps me cool and hides the bulge a must have you won t be disappointed as close to perfect as i have ever found everything s great except the crotch fastener watch your sizing but pretty good bring me back the quality from before love the hold best shaper ever great item except for the snaps better than my expectation comfortable and effective buying more quality may be changing great slimming and comfortable love this romper,on my where do i start i have been searching around purchasing all the wrong attire to wear to firm up my figure and hold that jiggle lol no but this is amazing it holds me firmly in all the important places it isn t very expensive and you can wear it under any garments it s a winner i bought this to use under my clothes for the summer i have used it twice without any problems i prefer this to other underclothes material is very stretchable and comfortable absolute difference if u are plus size with a stomach you feel much more secure in this provides enough support comfortable attached panty w hardly any lines which is a must i wear 16 and bought xl love this immediately helped smooth my middle and it is very comfortable i ordered the large i wear a size 14 pant 38 bust and this really improved the look of fitted pull over t tops and sweaters you won t be disappointed i highly recommend soft smooth and comfotable doesn t ride bunch or cut your circulation off buying more the only shaper i ve found that is loose enough on the leg opening so as to not cause a bulge i love these onesies i wear them under my clothes with footless spanx and they do wonders these were a bit firmer but not too firm to pull on and not uncomfortable i have one major criticism which is why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 they have snaps in the crotch and i can t do them up without a lot of sweat and trouble i replace them with hook good slimmer deffently better than the last one i tried and i would of gotten in a bigger size but i followed the chart and this is what they suggested i have one of these that i have had for over 3 years washed and dried without a second thought it is the most comfortable thing i own i get so uncomfortable in bras and it comes off the second i can get rid of it i hate having the girls unsupported though these give just the right amount of support it feels like i m not wearing anything no pinching digging sliding up i have also had 4 children 5 pregnancies the body of this feels good holding everything in tight i don t have to worry about muffin top hiking the top of my jeans over my tummy roll the snaps on the bottom can be a bit annoying if aligned wrong but it s not hard to get them right by all intents and purposes i want to give this a 5 rating however the new one i bought fell apart at the seam between the tank and the undies part after wearing it one time i need to break out the sewing kit and repair it i guess because i m not going to deal with returning during covid i will probably still buy more of them because they re just so dang comfortable even with a big hole also we all know that the ladies modeling these don t need them in a million years just for reference i m 5 6 and a size 10 12 and wear a medium could probably fit a large but i like it tigher in the bust as i tend to wear it without a bra i started wearing these after having my c section and it is the perfect amount of firmness and has given me some confidence since my tummy has never been the same my only wish is that the underwear portion be made of a thicker or less stretchy material as it over stretches and lets the back part of the tank top section ride up a bit also it rolls on the underwear part so it looks like underwear lines through my clothes this shaper is the best thing i have ever worn it is comfortable and shapes well without cutting off your circulation love this and plan to purchase in another color wish they made it in a tan color love love love this item is well made soft the bra part had no cups but kept you in place nicely the straps were adjustable the romper had sufficient spandex to hold everything in place i am really worry about that when i order online item because i am store person i have to look and touch the quality i am really excited when i received the item look at that it s super fit and quality is better than my expectation i purchased size m it is fit and good for me i am highly recomended this item nenough tight and your body firm with this romper i purchase black and i ll order another color five star absolutely love this romper it is so comfy and doesn t cause chafing like other shape wear i am so happy with it i am going to splurge on the beige colored romper one which was more expensive than the black colored romper definitely smoothes you out in the right places resulting in a confident look it didnt really hold everybting into place but more smoothed everything out it wasn t tight i was able to breathe and move around freely i oh my gosh i m buying more really fits smoothes your silhouette under clothes also cute with jeans and flip flops love i ve been buying these for years and wear them daily the lady 2 i received tore along the seam within the first week i m returning and trying again but if they tear again i will be forced to find something new this all in one provides great support and streamlining without sacrificing comfort and breathing it won t pinch or gather with movement either this is the best i ve tried and i ve tried many i like this romper comfortable stays in place i have one in black and nude purchased nude twice i am losing weight and had to buy smaller size helps to reshape during my weightloss i love it its

548,Maternity Oh! Mamma Skinny Jeans with Full Panel - Available in Plus Sizes,16.99,3.5,342.0,comfortable and stylish nice the stylish mom could be better not skinny jeans not skinny jeans at ankles not stretchy at thighs poor quality run small in the legs and thighs need a more curvy design comfortable great all purpose maternity wear not a maternity skinny jean cute but tight for terrible stylish cheap material great fit,this is the only pant i wear when going out bit snug in upper belly though and may not be good for summer because of synthetic flap but i am fine with it even in ca heat cotton flap would have been nicer for sure i ordered one size up which helped me would be a great addition to my other maternity clothes we lost the baby before i was big enough to wear these but based on previous pregnancies these pants would have been great im hanging on to them in case i get pregnant again down the road true to size very flattering look so cute comfortable dress them up to go out or with a t shirt for around the house perfect love them if you have a fuller behind these are not so nice they re also not really skinny jeans they are more like just straight leg jeans loose at the bottom of the legs these jeans are more of a straight leg or bootcut jeans the ankle is way too wide to be skinny jeans for size reference i am almost 5 5 at 138lbs 22 weeks pregnant i got a small it was a bit tight around my thighs this is a common isaue for me even prepregnancy i typically always have to size up on jeans but then they dont don t fit my waist so if your thighs are normally thicker than i would size up because these arent as stretchy or forgiving as i imagined the belly panel is very comfortable and these were a bit long on me by about an inch or two this is not full panel the waist band slips down and the pant has a very weird fitting both the words used in ad full panel and skinny are not true at all pant is very long returning this product these are tight in the thighs and loose at the ankle they are not skinny jeans they are much more like a straight leg or boot cut i orded them in a dark and light wash and i m not happy with the cut fit of either the light wash is much more granny ish than pictured i would return if i hadn t removed the tags and washed before trying on n nthe full panel is comfortable but it is the only redeeming aspect these jeans are poorly made when i got them in the mail i tried them on before washing them upon doing so i noticed you could see light through them especially at the seams i still proceeded to wash them and give them a try i wash all my clothes with natural detergent cold water and delicate cycle and line dry i put these on and noticed that they were fraying above the knees they run small and the legs of the pants aren t really giving meaning if you have wider thighs or calves swelling goes with pregnancy these pants wont fit well i even bought a few sizes up and they are super uncomfortable primarily from the no give in the legs so now i have pants i cant really wear legs too small belly band too big great concept bad design if you have curves the back part wont go over your butt and the thighs and legs are baggy looks like trash bags the butt area will be super tight and and the belly band fits perfectly im not sure if the dont know that not all pregnant women have big legs so just have belly and butt these jeans are comfortable not too tight i am 5 8 and they fit great i was hoping for more belly coverage it states full belly but to me feels like half it has a band that sits right below my chest which can get uncomfortable for the price and selection that i have in my area these are great fit great size was true im tall 5 10 and length was good could have stood to have been a little longer but not bad very comfortable the front panel does go a little low the bottom of panel stops about where the bottom of a zipper would so it makes me think sometimes its showing but so far it don t the tops i have cover it well but if you get a shirt that might be shorter in length just keep this in mind overall i like them and will probably buy another pair fit is okay wish the band at top was a little tighter these are definitely not skinny jeans they are straight leg very cute but has no stretch in the jeans if you have big legs and booty and go up 2 sizes i went up 1 size thinking they d last the remainder of my pregnancy nope i will have to return the pants i ordered the size that matched up to my normal jean size i ordered three pairs im still early in my pregnancy but i could not wear my regilar jeans they were just uncomfortable got these they fit but i still have room for as my belly grows i ordered 2 pairs first a large and they were huge so i returned and ordered a medium and they re tiny save your money wow these are so fashionable a true skinny jean i ordered a small and it fit like a glove i love the wash do yourself a favor and don t waste your money great fit true to size nice quality still a little big on the waist for a small,women's clothing,0

purchase and would definitely purchase them again n nlaurie most comfortable jeans i own has a super wide waistband so they pretty well stay in place all day no stretch out or sagging all day long only complaint is that with the black the material is almost like a velvet feel and attracts lint bad i love these jeans i will be buying another pair soon super soft well made and very slimming in the tummy area im 5 11 about 200lbs and these reach all the way to my ankles great pair of jeans for me i like jeans that have a stretch to them and are comfortable but i also like to have a nice fit especially around my legs so i figured these would be a good choice to try for starters this is almost like jeggings where you just slide them on and don t have to worry about zippers or buttons and it has a good stretch even though the idea is definitely like leggings these also still very much feel like jean fabric wise where you can tell it s denim and not a print fabric and i like that because it means they will hold up a lot longer than jeggings and still have the comfort fit wise these are great the fit around my legs to show the shape but they have a stretch so i can move around and not feel like they are going to rip or tear and it fit my thighs and butt where it showed it off with a bit of wiggle room so it is pretty true to size around my stomach is was a tad uncomfortable not sure entirely if it was suppose to kinda minimize the look of my stomach which is kinda did but i had to make sure to wear a long shirt to cover it or else it looked kinda weird and it felt slightly tight when i sat so ended up pushing down to my waist a bit over all i really did like the look and feel of these and would definitely get a few more pair in the future because they look nice and they are pretty comfortable for the most part and are convenient to toss on and go so i would definitely recommend this review was collected as part of a promotion i ve been needing new jeans for a few years not buy kept putting it off after two kids and settling into my figure i was dreading the process of trying on jeans these fit like a glove i m sure it won t be e same for all but i had a great experience i have more of a full stomach and thinner legs this review was collected as part of a promotion the look and feel of these pants were great but they were a super skinny design and did not fit true to size ran about a size too small they fit more like leggings than jeans if you are 30 or under and very skinny these would be great in the past i bought multiples of these jeans since they were the only ones i could find that fit me i have a smaller waist compared to larger hips butt they have changed the style and added front pockets that open were just sewn details before these jeans are not the same with front pockets less slimming at the tummy due to bunching of pocket fabric i ll be taking mine back and hoping they change back to sewn closed pockets next year i bought the black raven pair of these signature levi s and they were much smaller than i was expecting i have been wearing there size 8 for several years i bought a size 10 because i had gained a smidge of weight that made me want to go up a size i was expecting the size 10 signature leggings by levi s to actually be a little big on me instead i could barely get them on they are smaller than the size 8 that i have i m not sure what the problem is but definitely go a size up ladies or at least just try one pair first because i m sending mine back and i m going to try at 12 which i ve never worn in my life but i really don t feel confident that those will fit right either let me also just mentioned that the legs does not seem very stretchy at all these black jeans are completely different from the regular blue jean signature leggings that i ve been wearing for years so go with caution fabric too bulky thick like faux suede upholstery which formed rippling down both legs lark color is beautiful muted butterscotch sizing seems true they looks good well made but maybe are more suitable for perfect slimmer bodies i m curvy without being fat and disliked how it looked on me i gave them away these are very slim but the waist is a bit baggy for me the fabric is heavy denim so they will work nicely for cold winter wear not for summer very comfortable easy fit maybe a litte long as i am 5 2 great fit flattering perfect stretch i love that they have 5 pockets and still have the tummy control this is my go to pants for comfort and style too hard to get in not stretchy enough i really love these jeans these feel amazing and i love the shape,women's clothing,1

553,TeeHee Women's Ladies Value 6-Pack Crew Socks,11.99,4.0,65.0,worth it worth the money great comfy socks and great price feel and colors are great ladies teehee socks nice sock selection office socks run too small terrible pretty colors loving these socks better than i thought so cute great selection but a little tight nice and cute design socks bought from walmart cute socks but super tight,i don t like socks that are tight at the top of the sock these are wonderful they have a wide band at the top that doesn t get tight around my leg by the end of the day i would buy them again but with 6 in a package it will be a while before i need more i love the color of the socks i think that they will go with my quirky style well they stretch well for my feet size 11 in women as well as my mid width i would buy more if they came in more colors i love these socks i bought two packs and glad i did i may buy more in future are thin and the material is yet good for both cold days and warm days very nice socks pretty designs and comfort love the feel and the colors the ladies teehee socks are a six pack of assorted argyle colored crew sox sized 9 11 or shoe size 4 10 they are 97 polyester and 3 spandex they are machine washable with like colors overall length is 13 1 2 and are about 6 from the heel to the the elastic top the teehee socks are soft flexible and have nicely sewn heels and toes good value i am always looking for a good pair of lightweight socks to wear with my boots and these socks are a great weight for summer wear the patterns matched the picture so there were no color surprises there are a few essential areas on socks to consider the first is how difficult it is get the sock on your foot i had considerable difficulty with the socks because they seemed narrow over my instep as i was trying to insert my foot i had to bunch the sock up and start at the toe and pull the sock over my foot the foot was a little long for my size 6 and there was a little extra material at the toe and the heel seem was not in the right place however the toe seem was smooth and did not bother my toes there is a band at the top of the sock which caused considerable swelling in my lower leg when i examined the sock for quality i found that the inside of the sock had a lot of threads many of which ended up on my clothing when washed will work great for work dress socks that are comfortable wish they were just a bit thicker tho for warmth run way too small they bound my toes to the point where my toes hurt would not buy again terrible made really cheap and do not fit my size 10 foot n ncan i return to my local walmart store this socks itches me so much great comfortable socks not to heavy to wear in boots love these socks pretty color combinations fit well the arrived quickly and in good condition it s so hard finding good socks because i m picky about them i prefer them to be thin but stretchy and to hold up well in the wash i also like them to be cost effective and come in large packs the teehee crew socks fit all these bills the teehee crew socks are not only stylish with their cute argyle pattern but they fit great the fabric is soft and stretchy and they form fit to my foot with no bunching at the toes or heels they aren t too tight either they are snug but in a good way it makes me feel like they aren t going to move around on my foot or stretch out during the day these socks are easy to pull on and they stay up perfectly the toes and heels feel like they are slightly reinforced so they should be long lasting my ankles swell in humidity and they have accommodated this change in size from morning to night without getting out of shape i haven t noticed them pilling after going through the washing machine and even more importantly i haven t noticed them shrinking up too much in the dryer all in all these are some of the nicest socks i ve ever tried and i plan to get a couple more packs my review on the other variety of these socks i believe it was the striped ones stated that they were too tight and hard to put on or take off perhaps that was specific to that variety or maybe even that pair because i ve worn the argyle variety and they are great plenty of stretch and easy to put on and take off i will review the flowered variety once i wear them if this fit is the norm then i highly recommend these socks for value and comfort and looks they re fun i absolutely love he design of these socks i get compliments every time i wear a pair the different colors in the pack allows me to wear them with multiple items in my closet they are comfortable to wear hat i don t even take them off until it s time for bed i love the fact that these socks are on the thinner side some of my shoes cannot accommodate thicker socks and the wide variety of colors and patterns available i bought all 3 packs however they are not as stretchy as they could be to the point that getting them on and off is somewhat difficult especially around the ankle area i m hoping that they will loosen up a bit with time and wear if you are on the thinner side perhaps this will not be an issue for you i am not large but neither am i a skinny teen these socks are nice and warm and made to last the design is viberent i like color and the color choice is good i had to hide my socks from other family members the only problem i had with them is putting them on the design on the inside kept sticking to my toenails i would recommend these socks to anyone even though they are for spring and summer winter you need heavier socks to nkeep your feet warm ni still rate these socks at a 5 stars cute thinner style dress sock type but very tight fitting to try and get on your feet there is no stretch at all without a bit of soft stretch they feel cheap and i feel cheated n n i am giving them to my 11 year old and wouldn t recommend them,women's clothing,0

561,Ezi Womens Cotton-Rich Sleeveless Nightgown,14.75,3.9,186.0,comfortable lightweight nightgown cute and comfy good products good customer service comfy and cute cool summer nightgown the embroidery is so detailed and pretty nice cool nigjtgown lovely lovely color and detailing hole love it made in china so it doesn t fit dissatisfied knit fabric not cotton made small not all cotton would notrecomend,i received the pink label gown in a nice lavender color i decided to try this style as it seemed very plain and for me that is a good thing i have trouble sleeping with any gowns or pajamas that have snaps or buttons they seem to gouge into me and i have resorted to wearing men s oversized t shirts this gown comes to just above my knees and although it seemed scratchy itchy when i first tried on it was fine after washing so maybe it was the sizing or something the gown is 55 cotton and 45 polyester and it seemed cool enough for me and i tend to always be too warm i took off the little bow decoration on front and the label and i found it to be very comfortable after that i machine washed and dried it and it didn t seem wrinkled at all although personally i don t see a problem with something you re sleeping in being wrinkled the fabric is a nice light weight it is not sheer but not totally opaque either the keyhole neckline and smocking on the yoke are nice little feminine touches all in all although i wouldn t have gone out searching for a nightgown i m glad i found this one as it is so much better looking than an oversized man s t shirt the pink label by lati fashion nightgown is a lightweight easy care nightgown i have the xl i usually wear a large but i like my nightgowns to be roomy this garment fits the bill the cotton polyester blend makes it hold up wash after wash this was the second time we d ordered from this seller different items first time my wife liked these as well so we ended up placing a third order she says the fabric is quite breathable despite being only a cotton blend which makes them easier to care for nwe did have a problem with one shipment but the seller stood by it and the order was eventually fulfilled i have never really been one to wear pajamas or night gowns i don t like how they bind while i sleep because i move a lot what i really like about this night gown is that the material is really soft and has a little give to it when i turn in bed it doesn t feel like it is getting to tight around me the fit is flattering i have a large chest and it doesn t bind i did get one size larger than i normally would though for that purpose it is also made so that it doesn t show anything it shouldn t if you needed to wear it around other people but it is not so much material to feel like you are smothered overall i would recommend this product as i think it is cute and comfortable and should work great for anyone that needs a nice nightgown this nightgown is a thin sleeveless summer frock that is a very pale lavender color it has the typical embroidery and lace around the upper chest and neck area it would be perfect for hot summer nights material is 55 cotton 45 polyester i am 5 4 and it hits right about the knee area it did shrink a little after washing so it is a bit snug now i received my women s sleeveless cotton nightgown by ezi pink label lavender nite gown 3 days ago i cant tell you enough how comfortable it is its like a second skin this was here is an extra large fits true to size the embroidery is so detailed and pretty the length is just passed my knee it has some stretch to it its a pretty feminine nite gown you will love it this comes in different colors i got the light lavender it s very light nightgown great for summer i am not a thin person received size xl it fit with not too much extra space around my hips fabric is soft and the price is good this is a very pleasant surprise the material is very soft to the touch comfortable and just right for lounging around the house or sleep i love the design and would recommend sweet dreams this women s sleeveless cotton nightgown is a lovely lilac color and the detailing on it is looks quite feminine when i took it out of the package i was pleased with its appearance and when i tried it on it was loose fitting and at the knee length the fabric is soft and it s fairly comfortable i like that it s sleeveless and thin enough to wear in the summer but at the same time not so thin that you cannot wear it during the fall and winter i washed it in cold water according to the label and dried it on low however being only 55 cotton i should have realized it was going to shrink a little now it only shrunk a tad but it s noticeable i strongly suggest you wash it on cold and line dry it because with the other 45 being polyester it shouldn t need ironing and by not putting it in the dryer it won t shrink my photo shows it after being put in the dryer so if you get wrinkles after line drying it well at least it s still loose and the same length lol it came and this was a birthday gift for my wife and there is a hole in it you should of check it before shipping i love this it was perfect i ordered this so it would be easier for me after my hip surgery i would tell anyone to get this it feels so good well made but because it s made in china it s too tight around the stomach so i ended up giving away the 3 i bought stop forcing crap made from china down your patrons very poor quality material and sized not as advertised i have bought my nightgowns from walmart for 15 years and if it hadn t been for the aggravation i would have returned it very disappointed it s a nice nightgown but the description doesn t mention that it s a knit i wanted a lightweight cotton i wanted something soft this has scratchy trim around the neck i washed the two i bought or i would return them i like my nightgowns roomy so i ordered 2 sizes larger than normal so thankful i did as they just got they are made small nthe colors are beautiful and the material is nice but the sizing is way wrong it is not 100 cotton which is what i wanted but it is still comfortable too tight around the hips the gown is really small and cheap runs small very pretty this was advertised as cotton but turned out to be a cotton blend we do not wear polyester to bed because it lacks breathability,women's clothing,0

564,Hanes Women's Cotton Wear-Around Crew Neck T-shirt,10.5,4.3,1541.0,greatest little throw on day or night great nightshirt 6th year of purchase love them multiple uses okay but not really one size up to 3x scratchy against sensitive skin should be labeled xxxxlarge not one size fits all nicely made but huge hanes weararound sleep shirt disappointed sizing is not correct recvering in comfort red wear around best quality wider would be better one size does not fit all my summer go to a good sleepwear valuie comfy and oversized,absolutely love this little throw on gown dress i have bought one in every color for sister and and myself as well as extras in black i use it as a throw on dress pearls and head on errands wear it around the house all day it is darling throw a sweater over your shoulders and cute pair of shoes and it becomes a great little dress wish you made more colors i love mine so much i ordered a couple of more in different colors as far as length i am about 5 9 at it goes to my knees as for the os it would fit up to a 2x i do believe because i was in a 2x and now i am in a medium large now i have plenty of room wearing it but if your interested and wear a larger size try it you can always return if it is not a good fit these are good to wear around the house to be in comfort and even better to sleep in i waited a long time because i wasn t sure about it but i am glad i went ahead and got them very pleased with this purchase garment is sturdy but soft and comfortable 100 cotton many color choices nlaunders beautifully without damage or fading washer and dryer nsupposed nightshirt but has multiple uses beach coverup housedress and a nightshirt ntruly fits multiple sizes i have given them as an emergency sleepwear gift to friends who had lost luggage unplanned hospitalization campout or unexpected sleep over size 10 to 20 i buy an keep an xtra pink one to keep on on hand for such situations there is nothing better on the market for this quality comfort and price i use them year round hope they are always availabale i liked the older version of the wear around with the v neck also this seems a bit less roomy than the older version don t you hate it when they mess with a good thing oh and this isn t tag free sizing chart stated it was one size but would fit up to 3x i don t believe that is true as i am usually a 1x and since i wanted it extra roomy for sleeping up to 3x sounded good it fits but barely and there is no room for another 5 pounds i think i would have done better to go with a plus size to get the fit i was looking for otherwise once washed hung to dry it was soft and comfortable colors are pretty i bought a blue and a yellow just the sizing feels a bit deceptive the material is too scratchy for me to sleep in i bought two so i am just washing and drying them with most loads of laundry to soften them up they have been through 6 washings and they still feel too scratchy the size of these wear arounds is huge i usually wear a large tee shirt but these must be xxxxlarge the sleeves hang below my elbows not comfortable the fabric is thinner than the ones i ordered in the past hopefully i can salvage these by washing in hot water and hoping for shrinkage i expected this item to be virtually identical to the ones i bought a few years ago instead it was an inch or two shorter and about a foot smaller in circumference although it did fit i was expecting the loose roomy fit of my previous nightgowns it s huge i mean i got it because i wanted room in it but i didn t expect it to be so big fits like a 3xl it s definitely not one size fits all it s a slightly long t shirt they need to be offered in other sizes additionally once i washed and dried it once it shrank terribly i ordered 3 not pleased at all it s not the same longer odd shape bring back the original they say it fits someone up to 3x i wear somewhere between a 1x 2x and i can not wear this dress the only reason i gave it even a one star is because the fabric is nice i bought my mom several of these to wear around the house as she recovered from a heart attack and surgery they are soft and comfy like your favorite oversized t shirt she has been told to alternated between walking and resting these are perfect to wear for lounging around the house and yard throw on a pair of leggings and you are ready for a few errands i have only received my hanes wear around it arrived very fast the color is vivid and the size is perfect i am a 12 14 i have not worn it nor have i washed it i think i could give a much better review after it has been worn and washed and dried i love my night shirts i need to order more i like the weight of the fabric but a one size fits all i am not a large woman but bigger than most and the shirt needs to be a bit wider for ultimate comfort over all its ok all cotton pre shrunk what s not to love well since it was too small to wear none of the other characteristics made it an acceptable garment for me so comfortable i love tee shirt dresses i live in them during the summer will you ever have them with long sleeves it s really difficult to find real tee dresses these days many companies want to put darts in them and nip in the waist or horror of horrors make them out of polyester your dresses are the real thing i have had this product before these feel a bit stiff unfortunately i ve gotten bigger and they haven t the best priced sleep shirt around for the size 12 and under and craft shops offer all sorts of ideas for embellishments to make them special if you re medium sized and looking for a giant t shirt to sleep in this is that it is very comfy if you are looking for something feminine and flattering this is not that and it is not supposed to be of you are size xl or larger it will not be as oversized and will be more fitted i put it in the dryer to shrink it on purpose because i m short it will shrink in the dryer so if you don t want that hang dry

565,"Time and Tru Women's Essential Short Sleeve Crewneck T-Shirt, 2 Pk Bundle",9.88,3.9,249.0,great basic this is an excellent buy excellent quality t shirt nice and soft good fit sporty t shirt good sleep shirts not the same as in store material isn t the same very nice shirt runs very small great little tee beautiful blue soft relaxed fit too great basic t shirt time and tru for me not as good not the same as in store,i got the time and tru shirt in a black color this shirt has a rounded neck and short sleeves and seems like a very nice and breathable material it is thicker and nicer than i would have expected from a basic tshirt type i am very pleased to say i am impressed with the quality of the time and tru brand that walmart has recently rolled out this shirt is no exception this is a basic black tee shirt but has a fitted woman style that could easily be dressed up or down i love that it is a bit longer some shirts are so short you need a cami but this shirt easily comes to my hips and i am 5 5 not long enough for leggings but long enough that you don t have to worry about it riding up after washing it also seems like it does not wrinkle easily i would also say the sizing on this is true to size it is not a flowy top but more structured the shirt also has some stretch to the material i always love a rounded neck because i think it is flattering as well but the neckline is still not very low i think this is a great basic that would be great in many colors the walmart time and tru short sleeve crew neck t shirt is a durable comfortable addition to a summer t shirt collection the shirt is an easy care machine washable cotton polyester blend that you can either line dry or put in the dryer it doesn t easily wrinkle and has needed no ironing it is label free which eliminates any itchy discomfort the fabric is slightly stretchy which allows it to be an excellent fit i am a petite and and t shirts are often too baggy even in a size small not so with this one it fits better than many others i have tried the t shirt is blue sapphire heather which is a great color to wear with many items it blends in well with darker denim nice for the daytime and perfect to dress up with summer sandals some jewelry and a light jacket for a casual summer dinner or outing it would also work well with skirts shorts capri pants everything in a summer wardrobe i need to purchase some new t s for this summer and given the price these will be ideal if you are looking for a t shirt that comes in a variety of basic colors which are easily adaptable to your wardrobe this is an excellent buy i would recommend it especially if it s time to get rid of those old t shirts that are beginning to look time worn and you need a fresh start to your summer i received this time and tru brand name t shirt as a spark reviewer i chose the crew neck in the size small 4 6 i would have liked an xs but there were none available in stating that i will say that the t shirt is true to size as it fits a little big on me other than that i really like the material and i am one to check seams and stitching this is well made it s 60 cotton and 40 polyester so it did not shrink when washed and dried but did get softer and comfy it s your basic crew neck t that can be worn with jeans or under a jacket with skirt this is a staple that every woman needs i have several basic black shirts and they are a definite necessity this is not a form fitting t it s more a boxy style that can be tucked in or worn out dress it up to go out or to the gym with leggings a very versatile t shirt in my opinion this is a great value for such a good quality t that is not 100 cotton and did not lose it s shape once washed as you will see in a pic i put a scarf around it and a necklace just to show that it can be a dressy shirt too we all look bigger in pic s but i am 5 2 and weight is 90 lbs 32 bust 24 waist 32 hip i am actually very thin fyi tag free too i can t stand those picky tags in the neck very very soft fabric in a value priced two pack nicely made shirts that are slightly fitted if you are busty or wish to hide a little extra weight around the midsection consider sizing up from your normal size the white fabric is a nice weight not too sheer and not heavy either washes well did i mention the softness so so soft i have worn this shirt a few times and it fits great the shirt is true to size i washed my shirt a few times and it has not lost any color the black is still very black just like i like it it has not stretched either i do not dry my clothes in the drier usually most of the time i prefer drying outside so i can t say if the drier would or wouldn t stretch it or shrink it but so far with a few washes it s still looking pretty new i wore this shirt just to be around the house but i have used it to work out and it is really comfortable when working out even with my waist trainer underneath the shirt does not fit too tight it s definitely a shirt that i feel comfortable wearing i do not like shirts that fit too tight and that s probably one of the things i like best about the style of this shirt it is nice comfortable and not too tight i am definitely looking forward to getting more shirts like this one to wear just around the house or definitely to go work out and stuff i received the time and tru women s essential short sleeve crewneck t shirt free in exchange for my honest review through the spark reviewer program nthis t shirt is very soft it is a cotton polyester blend so i know it will not shrink much if at all during the wash and dry cycle i chose the blue color which is very denim friendly i wore it to bed because it was so comfortable nit is a very sporty style due to the crewneck it is not a tight crew neck like many t shirts can be it is a roomy crewneck almost a boat neck style as you can see in my photo i wear a size small time and tru is a brand that i have more of at home so i knew the quality would be decent i was worried about going into dressing rooms during the covid19 crisis so i bought this two pack of the same size i have at home hoping it would fit for the most part the shirts fit they weren t as stretchy as the material of the shirts i already owned so they were a little tight but not uncomfortable just more form fitting the price was the great the cheapest i found for just a couple of sleep and work shirts i wouldnt wear them out too cheap and olain looking they came in the mail really fast too very disappointed the white t shirt fit perfectly but there is a huge blue stain on the front tried on the black t shirt and it was too small both shirts came in one package both indicted the same size i ordered but the black one was considerably smaller width wise when the shirts were laid out one on top of the other a very sad experience i was really looking forward to receiving them but ended up with nothing i ordered one black and one white t shirt when i recieved it the black die was all over the white shirt you can even see the outline of the black neckline in the middle of the white shirt seem like great shirts if you order 2 the same color x9f x98 x9e material is not the same as in store these are made in honduras the fabric doesn t stretch the fit is terrible unless your a beanpole bust very small longer too looked like a sausage in it got refunded great to exercise is comfortable light weight and antic wicks moistutecaway from the body sizing very good not a thick top actually thin but good for home exercise i thought these were the same tees they made before and sold at walmart but they are not these are super thin fabric and run very small not a good fit like the tees they used to sell i am very happy with this little heather grey t shirt it s super soft extremely comfortable i like that it s lightweight and i can move around easily in it it does cling a bit to my body but not enough to make me feel self conscious i really appreciate the length of the t shirt it s not too long but long enough that it doesn t ride up in the back when i bend over i ve washed it a couple of times and it held up very well no wrinkles or seams gone twisty i love this type of t shirt because it is so versatile you can wear it casually with shorts or jean wear it to work under a blazer or with a skirt and even sport the t shirt on a night out on the town by accessorizing jewelry either way you go this t shirt has you covered i do highly recommend the beautiful blue sapphire color is like a dark denim and will go nice with pants shorts and skirts the small size 4 6 was a little big on me pictured but still quite soft and comfortable my daughter will be wearing this for work and out with friends as it fits her much better she likes it a lot and said it was nice and soft with a slightly loose but relaxed fabric fit so the small runs a little big because she is about 130 there are no tags which is great and the size and washing instructions are printed on neck of fabric i hand washed to save on electricity using machine and water turned slightly blue from dyes so that s probably why washing instructions say to wash in cold water with like colors only if you need to bleach use non chlorine only and tumble dry low or hang outside on clothesline like we do there weren t many noticeable wrinkles but if you need to use iron keep it on warm the material is thin but not too see through i would definitely recommend for only 4 88 but you can save 1 26 by getting the 2 pack bundle for only 8 50 last i looked the 2 pack doesn t offer all the same pretty colors buying separately but some i d like to get more in the purple black brown and sea turtle colors if they made an extra small but for now the sizes come in small to extra extra extra large made in el salvador this is a really great basic t shirt i have never tried a t shirt in this brand so i didn t t really know what to expect the quality of this shirt is very nice people wouldn t know it was from walmart unless you told them the shirt is a pretty shade of blue the thickness of the shirt is a nice quality and thick but not to thick to wear in the summer so far it has held up well in the wash i washed with like items and it came out without any piling this shirt can be dressed up or worn with jeans or shorts just add a nice necklace slacks and heels and you are set for work this shirt does have a high neckline i personally like that about this shirt i would recommend this to a friend and will probably buy this is other colors it also fits true to size i got this in a small and that is my isual shirt size and it fit well it isn t form fitting but doesn t hand loose of the body like a paper bag it has a nice fit to it i am very satisfied with these t shirts they fit well the fabric feels and looks very nice they keep their shape after washing i was no longer satisfied with the brand i used for years and decided to check out time and tru brand after my first purchase of time and tru brand t shirts i was sold and have purchased these several times time and tru is the new t shirt band for me bought a single one of these in a darkish blue some months ago and i love that shirt it fits comfy drapes well washes great looks like new i decided to buy the same but the color was no longer available and the v neck was not available so i bought a 2 pack same type same size different color and crewneck i am very disappointed these are a tight fit the arms are tight they do not drape well all in all not the same t shirt smaller than stated material feels nice but was a little snug order up a size unless you want firm fitting i ve bought many of these at the store and these are not the same these are made in honduras nthe good ones are made in el salvador like it but should have gotten it a size up cuz the fabric doesn t stretch beside that nice every day shirt,women's clothing,0

572,Time and Tru Rain Boot (Women's) (Wide Width Available),14.88,4.6,186.0,very happy customer fantastic wide width rain boots finally perfect boots hard working rain gardening boots great for most but not all cute slim boot tight on larger calves spring gardening rain boots city slickers stylish boots for the price delightful satisfied customer width perfect for me very satisfied rainboots great,they re super sturdy and they were packaged really well to ensure 0 folds creases to the boots the grip on the bottom of the boots are reliable i am usually a size 7 in vans adidas sneakers and i bought these boots in size 7 and there s a bit of extra room can be solved by wearing fuzzy socks i love that it is tall because there are big pot holes in the city and i have a habit of walking into those deep puddles thinking they re shallow nfor reference height 5 6 140lbs calf circumference 15inches and circumference of the top of the boots are a little more than 16 5 i got the medium width these are my favorite affordable find from walmart in recent memory they are heavy cute and fit so well thank god for wide width shoes and for 13 these are a must buy no hesitation it is so hard finding wide width boots so i was pleasantly shocked to find these especially for the price we have been getting alot of rain and bad weather lately so i needed a new pair of rain boots so far no issues at all they do their job n nthey do run a little large however if you wear thick socks it shouldn t be an issue definitely recommend i have 2 pairs of these boots one is for the rain and the other wide calf is for my mucking boots in the colder months i layer pants under sweats and these boots let me be comfy and warm my horses stall in behind our house and i muck it 3 times a day easy on and off and clean up is a breeze highly recommend them i just received my new rain boots yesterday and tried them on they fit really well plenty of room for wide calves which i do not have but wanted the wide foot so that i can wear whatever weight socks i want with them i usually wear a size 9 1 2 but when it comes to boots i go up a half size for the heavier sock the boots are all that i expected them to be for working outside in rainy wet weather and plan on wearing on errands in town when weather appropriate these boots look nice i don t mind that they are shiny and for the price paid you can t go wrong they seem well made i use these for gardening and they do not leak i like that they come in wide sizes they have a heavy tread on the bottom that keeps you from falling but also the tread cakes with heavy mud but that s ok you can just hose them off they are very black and shiny like patent leather great price i purchased size 10 w even though i usually wear 9 1 2 m in sneakers mostly because there is no half sizes after 9 and i m plus sized other reviews said that these boots accommodate large calves and they do to a point if you have muscular calves or are just a bit overweight and heavy in the calves and or have thick ankles they will fit you but if you are more than a bit overweight and have both muscular and thick calves you will need to get wide calf boots for me they were too long in the foot nicely roomy width wise and in the ankles and just a bit narrow at the top for my wide calves returned and since the wide calf boots were out of stock for delivery at the time i bought rain ankle boots in 10 m and they fit perfectly nice slim fit but not tight when i wear thick socks comfy tall flattering easy to clean very shiny black kinda wish it was matte but cute they are shinny and look like the picture i ordered size 7 because that s my size in sneakers but i wonder if a smaller one would had fit better they are fine but for me skinny legs and feet it feels kid of big but this is my pair of rain boots so i may not be used to it okay i normally wear size 8 5 or 9 in women s shoes i usually size up for boots one size considering that i can sometimes wear a size 9 i ordered a size 10 medium width the shoe part of the boot is too long for my foot the part that goes over your calf is tight but i can wear them if i had gotten a smaller size the boots would not have fit me you slip them on they are easy to put on a little harder to take off my size is 5 6 180 190 pounds with larger calves about 17 inches around the biggest part the boots i ll keep because i was needing something to wear to and from my chicken coop boots are comfortable and easy to clean fit perfectly i love the design and they were wide enough so i can put my feet in easily fits well with thick socks altho i haven t used yet in rain feels sturdy and thick to wear over jeans very pretty too not to mention bargain price nice boots for the price i usually wear between a 7 1 2 and 8 shoe size but looking at the shoe size guide and other reviews i decided to try out a size 7 for these boots the size 7 fits comfortably with a little room to spare i am looking forward wearing these boots in the rain well i ve always had problems with my calves but not with these rain boots they are true to size and look really cute when tried on just wish they came in other colors love love love the price of the rain boots perfect for my wide foot and calf actually wore them early in the day at farmer s market in oct no soaked pant legs that day when grasses dried i was able to put shoes back on have not yet started to use them outdoor but they are very comfortable the size is right and i can have two thin sock in it they look fancy ordered an 8 wish thru had half sizes so shouldve went down a size n nafter trying them on i didnt wear them gonna take them back soon i love how these are comfortable and they are a great fit for my wide and fat feet lol i ordered a size 10 these boots are a lot lighter than the ones i could find in the store this is a great buy at this price,women's clothing,1
573,"Hanes X-Temp Wire-Free Convertible Straps Bra, Style G507",13.5,4.4,643.0,great bra comfy and affordable a definite buy perfecto excellent quality comfortable and soft comfortable moderate support perfect with one caveat comfortable bra disappointed my covid bra light airy comfortable comfortable bra with nice support comfortable supportive full coverage bra i used to be hard to fit not any more solid colors are a bit different thaaan my previou comfortable fitting bra solid bra,i m 35 with history of dramatic cup size changes in my 20 s to now between a c dd then back to c creating my babies and significant weight loss recently have not been kind to me lol oh well n okay so with that said you can imagine i have to tame the half deflated water balloons on my chest daily these bras have been everything i have always wanted in a bra no wire no under boob sightings and the most comfortable hold you won t regret it moms i am a fairly large busted lady and find it difficult to find a comfy supportive bra without underwire this is it the bands underneath the breasts are wide enough to lift the girls and it s just super comfortable no urge to rip it off as soon as i get home and wow great price i ll be purchasing another this is the most comfortable bra no wires but still supportive smooth under t shirts i don t know the longevity for long term but for the price i can replace annually if needed went through my fair share of bras for work im a 38dd and the xl fits perfect tried this out for a day and forgot i had it on it is so comfortable not the cutest but keeps the girls up and doesn t make that weird uniboob just ordered another one i am a 3x gal i have spent so much money on good bras just to find out none of them fit properly the band isn t long enough the cup is too small or too big in desperation i ordered this bra for the price if it didn t fit i could give it away or even throw it away when i first tried on my new bra i was ecstatic it fit great it lifted great like the expensive bras i looked great and having a bra that actually fit perfect made me feel great i have since bought 5 more i love these bras excellent bra gives great support very comfortable and love the price i absolutely love these if you lift your arms and always end up having an underboob these are for you i don t have that problem anymore these fit amazingly no side boob no underboob no uncomfortable wire yet it does have a little padding to help with shaping i do everything with them now including my workouts they are worth every penny i bought a large i am a 36b and they fit to perfection hanes xtemp wire free sz l beige a good lounging casual wear bra super soft smooth fabric while this gives very comfortable gentle decent rounded support think hammock it does not really provide much assistance with actual lift nor defy gravity it does alleviate the discomfort of heaviness and b b sweat the band flips completely in and upward under the girls but it lays flat and is not uncomfortable i ordered the recommended size smallest large but needed to put straps after a lumpectomy last summer with recurring pain as well as cough an irregularity in my profile i was thrilled to find these bras they don t hurt my surgical sites they look great and they re affordable my only complaint is that the hook and eye closures are very stiff there are three that require multiple attempts to engage it s a first world problem i know it is lightly padded so no worries about it being too thin i dont like that the center isn t flat on my chest but i think that is a consequence of no wires its not that noticeable easy to adjust n nfeels good to me and still supportive without wires love it so comfortable and cute i wear a 38c large please keep selling these with the different color options thanks not only is it not that comfortable it fits odd and the convertible straps are not long enough not even almost long enough to crisscross which is the main reason i bought it this is my covid at home and comfy bra i normally always wear underwire but during this stay at home time i was looking for something that was like not wearing a bra but i could go to the mailbox in wear out to the store if i wanted and throw into the wash easily this is all of that at the best price point light airy comfortable it s weird how the cups airily puff out as my breasts don t completely fill out the cups at least there s shape while i do sometimes feel self conscious that the cups might look dented or flattened they maintain their shape in a hot sweaty summer these are truly comfy i just wish they had different colors on offer in my size i initially brought this bra in white in a size medium it fit a little on the tighter side so i thought that i would up the size when ordering this black one the large fit perfect i m a 36 d and this bra holds up great i m not a big fan of underwiring and for the price you can t go wrong i will be purchasing more in the future very comfortable casual bra but i would order a size up if you re close to a larger size i usually wear a 38c 40b and it fit me in a large band fits but middle between cups does not lay flat against my chest i would go a size up if i ordered again still it s good enough with tees and around the house i have a hard time finding bras nothing ever fits right i tried this one wore it for a couple hours and immediately ordered 3 more the padding is just thick enough to keep a smooth look in front my only concern is if it will shrink in the wash otherwise it s perfect the solid colors i bought white and tan are more flimsy than the older two toned ones i have and the elastic at the bottom of the tan one if larger than my 3 different two toned ones i absolutely love these bras they are so comfortable for me i would highly recommend them especially if you workout they are like wearing a sports bra i will definitely buy more this is a comfortable bra i don t need a lot of support small busted so the no wire option is good for me i would rather it only have two hooks as i feel three for a b cup is a little excessive but overall it is now a favorite,women's clothing,0

580,"Just My Size Women's Plus Size Pure Comfort Seamless Wirefree Bra, Style MJ1263",12.09,4.0,2619.0,great for xl chest sizes satisfied great bra so comfortable works with my hiatal hernia and gerd little to no support hopeless sizing not good inconsistency as far as sizing seamless wirefree bra do not fit comfortable support best bra ever sheer material best comfortable bra ever just my size women s plus size pure comfort seamle comfort comfortable does the job,so i have an m cup chest and am pregnant right now ive purchased at least 6 other bras from amazon and other online shops and none of them fit right i was really starting to feel like it was a lost cause for a comfy lounging bra but this one actually fit feels comfy and i really hope itll last definitely buying more perfect this is replacing my worn out genie bras but worth it love the fit the fabric and the comfort provides full coverage and enough support and honestly i could forget i have it on wore it for my walk today the moisture wicking really works not at all sweaty underneath the girls i m going for at least two more as others have stated this bra runs a little small i usually wear a 3x by had to get a 4x in this one that being said i absolutely love this bra it is so very comfortable very soft it has great support even for bigger girls like me you cant go wrong with this bra i love these bras i am very large chested 38h i bought a 2xl and it works well for around the house for me personally it s not enough support for me to come feel comfortable going out in but it is super comfortable and supports well enough for around the house i will probably sew the shoulder straps up a little snugger to give myself a little more lift finally found something that works with my hiatal hernia and gerd i did order the largest size available 6x which was two sizes larger than the size guide indicated for me i would wear a 48b under normal circumstances but i m so glad i ordered up because a smaller size wouldn t have worked i was concerned that it wouldn t fit because it looked small out of the box but it does have a lot of stretch if you are larger chested and looking for a sports type bra this is not the bra for you there is very little support also the straps can t be adjusted and slide off my shoulders the fit is pretty true to size and it is comfortable if you are looking for a bra to wear around the house or to sleep in the fabric is soft and breathable way too small apparently they have changed their sizing i ve worn this particular item for years and wore a 2x after reading the reviews i saw others had commented the same so i ordered a 4x as was advised when i opened them they looked like they would fit a pre teen they do stretch but the band below the breast area rides up and is no where near what the original bra was my advice is to buy a larger size don t fit right i got a 5x it says 5x but it looks like it s made for a teen no way it is a 5x no consistency as far as size goes bought the same size i had previously and it was 2 inches smaller around the bottom makes a big difference in being comfortable or not after breast surgery i was required to wear a sports bra i read the reviews and ordered two of these thankfully the reviews said they ran small i ordered two sizes larger than normal and it fit very comfortably with room to shrink a bit after washing they were very comfortable even after surgery i hand washed the bras and laid flat to dry am very pleased with my purchase i had this in the jet color and they fit comfortably which jms was out of so i ordered 3 more but in black and beige these are not the same the cup size does not stretch and they will not stay below my breasts they creep up very dissatisfied and will not order again gave them away fits great i actually order one size smaller so it holds me in better super comfortable and supportive i ve had big boobs since i was 12 and have always worn underwire bras and just thought i had to but i will never go back to underwire this is a whole new world of comfort and support my only issue is that after a few months of washing and wearing the elastic seems to give out and the support is gone but i have only experienced this in other colors fabrics so far the gray and black striped fabric is holding up to wash and wear fingers crossed i read the reviews and ordered 2 sizes bigger than i would normally wear and they are fantastic they are soooo comfortable soft and not itchy anywhere they give more support than i imagined too i love these bras they are so much better than the sports bra i normally wear for a daily bra they are way more comfortable and have more support they don t ride up in the front or the back they are perfect for me very comfortable but super sheer similar to the top of control top pantyhose i bought these to wear to work but i couldn t wear them because it looked like i wasn t wearing a bra i am a d cup and they are supportive enough but it provides nothing when it comes to nipple coverage i would have returned them but they are comfortable to wear around the house omg i have a large frame and a smaller breast size makes finding sizes darn near impossible these bars are amazing so comfortable you fir get your wearing it i wieshit was a bit lower cut but i love them i got 1 black 1 white 2 beige ones perfect fit the just my size women s plus size pure comfort seamless wirefree bra is very comfortable it s a little difficult to get on because you put it on over your head and have to stretch is as you do once you have it on and adjust the girls correctly it s very comfortable but it does nothing for your figure unless you have a lovely shape to begin with i love this bra but it s not magic love it so comfortable i forget i have it on love this brand i bought 2 white 5x bras and this blue 5x this 5x was smaller than the 2 white 5x its tight but i can wear it are the colors different with their sizes than the white ones i need the nude ones are they 5x white or 5x color good coverage my standard bra size is 40dd i chose 3x for this bra style had an episode of shingles across my back this is the only bra i can wear because of the skin sensitivity looks ok under my clothes,women's clothing,0
581,Mark Alan Women's Midi Puffer Coat with Hood,15.0,2.6,26.0,love it incredible runs small runs small but good quality cute but small defective irregular manufacturing sleeve issue arms shoulders too small incorrect sizing incorrect sizing tight in the arm sleeves area,i love it it fit like a glove i typically wear a small but got a medium and it fits great so size up one size super cute love the gold detail and hits me right above the knee i m 5 3 i love it great quality color its warm good price and arrived very fast runs small it s right around the chest and arms it s a nice coat but the size is off please at least go up a size larger it covers by behind but tight in the arms and chest please work on it this runs a little small but it is a nice quality coat i recommend you size up one size to be comfortable i loved the coat but the sizing is way off i am between a medium and large so i ordered tge large it was so small that i couldn t get it zipped sent it back and got an extra large that was snug but is ok the length on this coat was below the knee exactly what i was looking for however the sleeves on this coat were incredibly tight i had my daughter try it on she is way smaller than i am and it was also tight on her only buy this coat if you have incredibly small arms nice looking but at least two 2 sizes smaller very disappointed ndo not waste your money nneeds less than a star rating defective manufacturing of arms on coat ex coat fits like size purchased the arm section fits like 2 sizes smaller the coat looks fine but the sleeves are sewn straight all the way into to the sleeve underarm so it is extremely tight and pulls there is no way you would be able to wear a sweater or a heavier top with this jacket i returned it arms shoulders too small unfortunately i have to agree with the other reviewers coat was missed size fit my 10 year old daughter ordered a size larger fits like a girls 12 too small runs small ncant move arms runs very small and it s very thin ordered a size larger fits like a girls 12 too small i had to return this item because the arm sleeves are extremely tight there is no way you could wear multiple shirts or a thick sweater with the arm sleeves like that,women's clothing,0
582,"Hanes Men's and Big Men's ComfortWash Tank, Up To Size 3XL",7.62,4.3,743.0,price does not reflect the quality of this item cool and comfortable great tank good shirt horrible tag quality tank but too long won t fit if you have hips poor fit bad buy outstanding customer service returned item it s comfortable not for my shape wrong size garment dyed sleeveless tank top these look like they ve been washed 100 times big disappointment not worth the 10 excellent tank top,i purchased several in different colors to layer over women s tanks to wear while exercising the style and it are just what i was looking for fabric is soft stitching is even well made not some cheap looking or feeling product definitely recommend my son got these tank tops and loves them he a big guy and a lot of times the sizes are not a true fit these fit him the way he wanted them to he likes them a bit loose he liked all the colors available and received them earlier than expected which was perfect timing also walmart was the only store that had tank tops available this late in the season and at a great price i am a woman and wear a small medium in women s tops i bought this in medium due to it being 100 cotton it did shrink a little after washing and machine dry but was still too large especially in the arm holes i stitched it up under the arms and it fits now i think a small would do better otherwise the medium weight fabric is 100 cotton and feels great am female and love these shirts for summer exercising and sleeping love the casual fit but wish it was cut a slightly wider on top of shoulders to hide bra strap yes i know it is men s shirt and they are not worried about hiding bra straps haha no one makes casual loose fitting cotton shirts for women so i found this in men s bought several colors love the pastels and so soft slightly obsessed very comfortable and fit great but please tell whoever thought it was a good idea to put giant tags on the back of the shirt that no one wants those they are annoying and pointless if you have some sort of tag fetish then just put it in the inside bottom of the shirt enough with these giant hard to remove tags already took a star off just cause of that stupid tag these shirts are super comfy and seem to be built nice and tough i m very happy with the feel and quality of material and work they fit great in the chest and gut they are a bit long for the size though with running shorts they cover them with jeans i have to really pull up some material to get into my pockets i am disappointed in the tank fit it is nothing like the picture the straps are not as wide as pictured the armholes are huge and the bottom is tight over my hips i have to wear it bunched up at my waist i ordered a medium which is what i usually wear in a unisex shirt these are definitely cut for a man the material is soft but not see through and i like the color i wish they fit better these will be relegated to the sleep shirt pile the material is of good quality and is soft and sewn nicely i do not like the fit of the garment the top fits oddly around the front of the armholes towards the breast it gaps and does not look good i am dissapointed and was really hoping for a fit as nice as the material the shirt came very wrinkled and no tags on it it appears to be a used returned item new should have tags right how else do you bar code and scan that it s been purchased shipped etc i ve purchased clothes online before and they may have some wrinkles when they arrive where they are folded and shipped but this is wrinkled like it came out of someone s dirty clothes basket the pictures are a few minutes after i opened the package no plastic wrap no tags extremely disappointed and would not purchase again while i like the longer length and fabric of the shirt the armholes are huge i ordered a small and the shirt fits but looks like it stretched out under the arms i will probably sew a few quick seams up the sides to take them in instead of returning these all the colors were completely off from the pictures on the website everything else was fine but the colors ruined it the names of the colors accordingly to the website were accurate but not the color itself n nnevertheless the customer service is outstanding i couldn t be more please d n nthank you for offering a hassle free customer service d in this time and era an excellent customer service like yours it s what it keeps me loyal to your brand shirt is quite heavy looks as though it runs small hope it doesn t shrink this shirt was an obvious return it was stuffed into the mailing bag no display bag or anything horribly crushed i note i was charged full price not very good customerr satisfaction practice i am very very disappointed comfortable but for this gal the armholes are too big shows most bras my husband likes the one i got him i d give him mine but coral isn t his color the fabric and quality is great on these tanks but they really don t translate to my female body shape i haven t yet figured out how to modify them to fit but i m still working on it the t shirt is great but i ordered a large and they sent a men s large i saw large on the tag and thought it was a woman s size and washed it i m pretty sure they won t take it back but i have not contacted them the first ones i ordered where two times too big so i got a smaller size and they are almost too small the arm holes are not sewn right they stick out so after the second time i think i will cut my losses and not order any more these comfortwash tank tops look like they have been washed 100 times and they have a horrible itchy tag in them if i wanted some old tank top i would go to a second hand store i am very disappointed with the quality of this product it does not even say that it is a hanes product and it seems very small for an extra large overall definitely not worth the 10 i paid i was very disappointed with the quality of this item there is nothing to indicate that this is a genuine hanes article and if it is it is a far poor quality than i have ever purchased before definitely not worth the 10 paid for it i couldnt believe the high quality of these shirts at such a low price the colors are great and cheerful and the material is comfortable and the fit perfect walmart is the only way to go for tank tops,women's clothing,0

lightweight dress love the soft like a t shirt and loose feel washed well ordered several different colors this is a great lightweight dress for hot days and with a blazer and some cute boots also great i have been unable to locate an appropriate belt for it and i will admit that as a result i do not look as though i have a flat stomach okay to begin with it is not exactly flat lol and the fabric puffs out a bit but that is okay it is nice to be able to wear this with tennis shoes and a crossbody purse and big hat once winter comes i will be wearing this steel grey dress with black stockings black combat boots and a black blazer and black crossbody i do not like to wear too much black haha so i think the dark gray will compliment nicely great bargain for 10 whats not to like at this price point im beyond pleasantly surprised by the quality and it fits great too the pockets seal the deal i bought 6 of them and won t be wearing anything else all summer i highly recommend have not washed yet but upon arrival even nicer than thought pockets hit at right place sleeves holes not too large or small nice especially for the price 5 7 approx 179lbs 45 bust ordered xl soft comfortable big pockets cheap perfect to throw on after shower i have 4 in different colors and usually sleep in them if you really wanted to you could add jewelry and a scarf and wear just about anywhere as a real dress the only downside is that the fabric is a bit slow to dry and may require a longer dryer setting was at store for groceries and when i saw this and the price got it and it was surprised how i love it feels like a tee knit so comfy and cute doesntand have pockets i see online now they have with sleeves more colors and prints so i just bought those other styles online as well for reference im 5 feet and 104 pounds and the xs is great a little long on my petite frame but its ok these dresses are absolutely wonderful they are so material that feels good on the skin and it has pockets which i d love i was so happy with this dress that i purchased every color available which was kind of nuts since i had already purchased quite a few items already but that s how much i loved it it would be a wonderful gift but i m keeping all the ones that i purchased for myself lol this dress is fantastic the material is soft breathable and versatile i ve worn it around the house and office it s super easy to dress up or down it washes well too oh and the pockets the pockets hold a good bit without bunching awkwardly i ordered this item in black and navy and will soon have the wine colored one these will work great as transition pieces between seasons and as basics for a capsule wardrobe happy shopping ordered two for santa anna s and 90 to over 100 degrees in california these are the coolest most comfortable dresses i own i m back for two more wish they had more colors there s nothing fancy about this tee shirt dress it does have inseam pockets and is my hot summer day uniform wish there were more colors when i saw the price of this dress i did not believe it could be of any quality i mean 10 it was laughable but it had high ratings in the reviews so i decided i would try out the steel grey one well call me shocked beautiful flowing fabric skirt hit just below the knee on me i am 5 1 the neckline was high but comfortable and the arm holes gave great coverage the color popped this grey has enough blue in it that makes it work with a denim jacket and looks great with my sterling jewelry i was hooked i ended up buying several more black blue paisley and wine i highly recommend this dress super soft and a great staple piece 128lbs and 5 feet 4 inches and small was great this dress is so perfect i bought 3 ni wish it came in a style with cap sleeves ni like to wear it over a maxi skirt of similar material to give it an evening appropriate function and appearance bought this in a medium i m 5 9 135 lbs thinking it would be as roomy as other walmart dresses i ve purchased in this size it s a bit snug across my 34a chest which isn t a problem the dress has a nice swingy weight and looks well made my only complaint is the pockets they add extra bulk where i don t need it might be a great little dress for those with no hip curves nice fit some dresses like this are almost like a tent they are so wide not this one i really like the way this dress lays i ordered a medium and the length is perfect im 5 ft 3 inches i weigh about 125 and medium is fine but the bust couldn t be much smaller in my opinion the arm holes are good and do not show my bra i appreciate that ill be wearing this year round with light or heavier sweaters boots will be cute with it in winter sandals are perfect for summer two thumbs up thin material very comfortable to wear in the house or out i usually wear a size 12 14 i purchased the xl roomy and soft not itchy at all great as a night shirt or over a bathing suit arrived fast most of order in two days still waiting for other half of my same order not expensive but will probably last a couple summers i love this so much i now own six of them in different colors so much cooler than shorts etc it has become my summer uniform i work outside in it clean house in it i put it in a laundry bag and put it in the washer and hang it up to dry i am tall and it comes a little above my knees love love love this dress so comfortable and love the big pockets i highly recommend it fits true to size and its the perfect weight for both warm days and cool days with a little sweater bought one in every color just

you have the solid colors to wash i use warm water and dry on medium setting for 20 minutes then i hang to dry any wrinkles just disappear did i mention there are 2 pockets would like to see even more colors sizing is really not an issue i usually take a large but ordered the xl and the dresses all fit even under the arms mine are not quite as short as the picture for which i am thankful at 9 97

591,"Extreme Fit Knee High Sport 6-Pair Sport Compression Socks for Men and Women, S-M",42.0,4.0,408.0,would highly recommend great after surgery fantastic set of compression socks love these socks size adjustment love the socks but 1 pair were 2 different sizes retains sweats moisture not to size very disappointing fit good compression and comfortable perfect compression nice compression pretty good,i got them for my husband because he has varicose veins since he is on concrete at work for 10 hrs a day i have noticed a significant change in the way his calves and ankles look when he comes home these socks are awesome and do what they are made for i have to add that my husband takes about 5 mins to put them on due to the compression got them for someone with recent heart by pass operation ankles and calves tend to swell after this surgery he really likes them says these compression socks really help fantastic compression socks colorful and helping my feet and legs each day i wear them thanks for a great product these socks are great love them they sure do the job they make your legs feel so good they give your legs so much energy you gotta get em exactly as pictured i absolutely love the colors i wear a size 9 shoe and ordered a small they fit perfect they re comfortable and have good compression compared to other socks i have bought i also ordered a pack for my sister who loves the socks as well she wears a size 7 shoe and the small fits her perfect as someone who is on my feet all day and have tried many different compression socks these are by far my favorite ones i will definitely order these again good quality for the money highly recommend this is my favorite brand of compression socks they are durable and fit well even though i have a lot of swelling in one leg these socks are thicker than many compression socks i have had in the past even from the same brand hoping they will be warmer since winter will be here soon i think you will like these socks and they are a great buy i brought a size larger since the reviews say they run small i usually wear a womens size 8 1 2 and bought large i really like these knee highs but the foot is a bit larger so the heel is higher than i like but i really do like these would guess that if your calf s large than 20 than a large will be too small one pair were 2 different sizes and the one that s too small i can t wear it s way too tight and idk how to exchange without doing the whole set which i dont want to do plus i already wore them thinking i could make it work so that really sucks however besides that i love them no leg pains since i ve bought them so just make sure you check all the sizes before you wear any plus the price is unbeatable also to note it would be hard for an elderly or disabled person to put these on i am a plus size woman and wear a size 10 women 8 mens shoe the fit of this item is a little off for my body the toe area of these socks are long and the calf area of this item is extra tight i wear shoes size 6 female i bought s m these socks are on the thicker size so it cramps my toes to the tip of my shoes worse is that it retains sweats other compression socks i have had the moisture eliminator so i don t feel sweaty n ni wore these 12 hours a shift averaging 7 miles and definitely felt the sweatiness hotness at mid shift n nso no i don t recommend these if you are active all day i really like the socks they fit my feet and my calves they re nice and tight they re snug they re not too snug they re really good blood pressure socks cuz i have varicose veins they work just about as good as my 250 blood pressure sucks that i bought two years ago glad i have these to go back to thank you so much the product entry on walmart com had no real sizing except for shoe size being a woman with larger calves i went to amazon to find a better sizing guide regardless not to size i ordered the l xl and the foot part of the socks appears to be closer to a size 11 while the calf part of the sock i could not get all the way down my arm at 10 inches round at widest let alone even halfway up my leg at 16 inches round at the widest calf part n nevery pair i ve ordered from multiple brands seem to be made for people who have zero leg definition n nif these actually fit you they did seem to be made from quality material good quality socks too hard to get on with arthritis hands when i have a good day and can get them on they are really great nhard to get off after a long day ni m sure for people that dont have arthritis they would be able to put them on more easily ni really liked the colors the first knee high compression socks i bought from this company were perfect they came all the way to the knee with good compression and they have been very durable nthe second set i thought were knee high but were only over the calf though the ad pictures looked knee high it did not specifically say knee high again construction and materials were nice nthis third set said knee high they got here and they are shorter than the over the calf and immediately start to roll down as soon as i put them on anither problem is those pretty chevrons on them are the tightest part of the sock and cause constriction great materials and construction ni am disappointed i need one highs and i need even compression and them not to roll if you are a young person buying these for soccer socks then they are perfect if you are a 72 year old man like me buying them for compression socks they are good but not perfect each place where there is a decorative stripe on the outside of the sock there is a bundle of yarn on the inside of the sock which leaves creases in my legs for compression socks i want compression not decorations which cause large creases in my legs the creases disappear within a couple of hours after taking off the socks with that said i find the socks extremely comfortable and they do the job as compression socks time will tell how well they hold their elasticity but after a week of wearing the same pair i am very pleased with them the size large xlarge are the perfect size for me with 10 1 2 shoes 5 9 tall and 170 lbs i would buy them again but i would prefer plain socks without the decorations they are a little too short should be an inch or a inch and a half longer it would be better without the color lines because they make the socks little bit uncomfortable my husband has used 180 medical stockings for 10 years these were perfect because they have graduated compression like medical stockings the fit was perfect and the compression is as much as the 180 medical stockings the price is so amazing we are placing another order for more i wear a size 6 5 7 shoe these socks have too much room in the foot to fit me the arch and heel come nowhere close to fitting my foot properly the compression in the calf and just below the knee feel great i wore these socks a couple of time and my legs felt great however i needed the compression in the foot and ankle area i ended up giving these to a friend who wears a size 10 shoe they fit her perfectly helped a lot with swelling in legs do not like the indentations the wavy material makes should all be smooth material i just love everything about these socks very comfortable and help with the swelling in my feet and ankles,women's clothing,0

these so comfortable and cute time and tru slip on shoe adorable runaround sneakers that extra something fun little sneaker snakeskin dupes great shoes just dont fit me well grab these fast awesome do not miss out on these super cute and extremely comfortable affordable trend waiting for new colorways size runs a little small,i ve purchased a lot of shoes from walmart recently because they are such good value especially if i can snag them on clearance these particular pair i purchased online as i thought they may sell out fast they are so cute and most importantly comfortable the snakeskin print is perfect with a hint of gold very eye catching but not loud omgosh these are the exact dupes from steve madden slip ons the snake print with the metallic gold embellishments adds an extra flair to these shoes totally perfect for jeans shorts or whatever check them out super comfy and under 15 yeah just bought these shoes so cute and comfy they don t feel cheap even though they are inexpensive i love wearing them with jeans and a cute top and due to the gold metallic flecks it dresses the outfit up all while remaining super comfortable they are a must buy i m between a 7 1 2 and 8 these are 7 1 2 and fit great so no need to size up plenty of room but not loose the foot bed is very comfortable i wasn t sure if i would like them because i m not a typical animal print person out of the box i was skeptical until i tried them on they look really nice paired with simple black leggings or jeans with a solid top they are perfect i purchased these in my usual size i sometimes need a wide shoe but i found the wide too big and regular size fit perfectly these shoes have memory foam and are comparable to a very popular more expensive shoe they feel like you are are wearing a very supportive tennis shoe a great find and i always get compliments walmarts time and tru slip ons have become my go to shoe i am a teacher and am on my feet all day these shoes are comfy and have excellent cushioning at 15 the price cannot be beat i have them in black olive taupe and now snake print i am in love thank you walmart so cute haven t worn for long periods yet but the cushioning feels great right out of the box i originally ordered a 10w but found i did not need the wide width so i am going to return them and have already purchased the regular 10 in store walmart shoes have stepped up for sure i used to not be able to wear walmart shoes but their quality has improved significantly a true to size super cute for fall well worth 15 i love these steve madden dupes these slip ons are so comfortable to wear plus give me all the snakeskin print this fall the only thing i didnt like was that my left shoes pattern was a bit different from the right but from far away you don t notice as much had trouble with the sizing on these after trying 3 different sizes i have concluded that you need to go up at least 1 2 size even at that the shoe was not comfortable on my foot rough stuff inside the shoe made it uncomfortable to wear with or without socks i love these in the store and online more than on my feet theyre adorable but dont fit my feet maybe because i have low arches im disappointed because i wanted these to work so bad great looking and well made just not for me super cute and no one will know they came from walmart the gold is subtle not obnoxious or bright they look exactly like the picture true to size i wear an 8 5 and that size fit me comfortably i dont like these types of boat shoes nbut i love these the color patterns do metallic plus so comfortable with wider width and memory foam insoles really great the steve madden dupes are so comfortable and i think better looking than the more expensive shoe i ordered a size 7 that is usually what i wear they fit perfectly i love that the snake skin has a shine to it so when the light hits it you say flex of gold love love love these super comfortable i would give them 5 stars if they fit perfectly they were a tiny bit big i would recommend sizing down 1 2 size unless you plan on wearing thick socks i would definitely keep these if they didnt have a 1 2 size smaller it wasn t that big a difference just my preference at 14 97 you cant beat these super stylish and comfy slip ons i don t usually write reviews but i had to write one about these sneakers i have issues with my feet and ankles but i walked around all afternoon in these and they were so comfy no breaking in period needed they were comfortable from the minute i put them on the colors are so cute they re a snakeskin print with flecks of gold throughout they look really cute with skinny jeans and don t make my feet look extremely big the way some slip on sneakers do they also look expensive and seem to be well made i m usually a size 6 5 medium width and that s what i ordered and they fit perfectly i would snag a pair of these before they sell out these stylish shoes are not only stunning but comfortable fits true to size you can dress them up or dress them down an affordable way to keep up the trends without breaking the bank definitely a fashion must have great quality so cute and comfortable i m on my feet all day at work and these have been a great addition to my work shoe collection i will gladly buy any additional colors i love these shoes i normally wear a 7 5 in shoes so i got the 7 5 and they fit great i m very impressed with the great quality they do not look cheap they are very comfortable do not rub the back of my foot and are super stylish nice looking shoe i wasn t thinking when i ordered them that they would not fit same as canvas shoe the type of material used doesn t allow give so they are about a half size small,women's clothing,1

596,"Radiant by Vanity Fair Women's Invisible Edge Smoothing Slip Short, Style 3412385",6.96,4.4,213.0,size guide is incorrect perfect foundation garment the best ever hinder binders very good product very good price perfect soft and comfortable really so so beware the seam in the crotch sizing is way off just what i want for under dresses great but not long enough in legs lightweight support my favorite could be longer good buy for the price nice shorts nice comfy,i am a size 8 10 so according to the size guide i should order a medium i received my item in the mail today and a medium is marked as a size 6 unfortunately i need to exchange for a larger size due to walmart s sizing guide being inaccurate n nif interested in purchasing this item please order a size larger than usual item is comfortable however i am a size 10 about 165 lbs and ordered xl the fit is perfect and these slip shorts are so comfortable these are the bomb got a few pairs in the store last year not in store this year but found on line ni ordered a bunch more for me and had my sister try she loved so we ordered her a bunch nthe are so smooth under dresses skirts and pants have just enough hold to stop the jiggle and pull you in a little but not kill you in the process the raw leg edge ensures the smooth look and does not roll don t stop selling these i have been shopping for this kind of support for a long time and this is the least expensive by far i was a little hesitant about the quality because of the price but it is very good quality lightweight and just the right amount of smoothing support to wear under a dress skirt or pants but especially smoothing to wear over bulky underwear due to bulkiness of womens intimate health care products pads invisible laser cut leg so no leg muffin poof runs small i m 5 8 and 170lbs i like the 2x size perfect for me this undershort is very soft and comfortable the only thing is that one need to choose the size according to the number and not to the letters size ex my size is 10 and it says 3xl eg 10 i think that the letters are kinda wrong no problem with the fabric it keeps soft after several washes love the product until lace seperates from panty at waist 4 out of 7 i am a size 8 i sized up one size to a large based on other reviews and the waistband rolls badly these are not terrible or uncomfortable but i recommend going up 2 sizes to avoid the waistband roll it s not worth the trouble to exchange so i just returned i ll stick with my jockey skimmies and don t have to size up at all so disappointing could have been perfect but these have a straight seam in the crotch not a patch shaped crotch which all women s underwear should have there is this stupid triangular shaped piece of fabric tacked in over the seam which does nothing for comfort or the protection of lady parts everything else is really good legs don t roll up which is great which is why it got 2 stars but this problem ruined them for me the downfall of online shopping i guess i really want to be able to give 5 stars because i was looking to replace my vassarette version of these slip shorts and these are identical i m very pleased about that but there s a big problem which is that i ve wasted good money trying to get the right size out of this brand the chart is apparently wrong see pic i wear an xl according to both my vassarettes and the chart but the vanity fair xl are too tight so i ordered 3 pair of the 2xl and they ve proved too tight too i hate to do it i really do but what the heck is a consumer to do other than leave a 1 star review these are not shapewear which is the point for me they do however provide great coverage when wearing dresses and keep your thighs from sticking together in the heat unlike standard shapewear the leg and tummy openings on these slip shorts don t roll or bind the lace at the waist is a bit fragile so use care when pulling them up but i love them use to get the exact thing from vasserette and was bummed when they apparently quit carrying them then i stumbled across this brand and was so happy that i immediately bought 7 pairs highly recommend for the price its great but it needs to be longer bc you can see a line under your pants on your thigh midway i stretched it out on that area only and its not as noticeable so overall i m happy with it this is a very light weight slip short it does provide some smoothing support but i would have rather had a little thicker fabric if you want support and light weight this is for you by far the most comfortable slip shorts i ve tried i ve bought 3 pair as they re my go to under summer dresses to prevent the dreaded thigh rub cool enough and stay in place but don t cut into you creating lines and rollover support is modest but still highly recommended so extremely comfortable the only draw back to these is that the legs are a little short and they tend to roll up if they were 2 longer they d be perfect noverall good product for

597,Women Winter Coat Printed Hooded Pockets Warm Fleece Floral Button Coat Jacket,34.99,1.6,48.0,looks are deceiving really small and thin the extremely low quality is disappointing do not buy this coat fishy looking jacket not as described do not buy this coat do not think about ordering this not worth the purchase women s winter down coat beautiful coat don t buy do not buy very small item from china don t buy piece of junk no down and not for winter cute cozy comfortable not as i had hoped,the sizing is smaller than you expect it s a very lightweight and it looked to be more substantial i was a little shocked to see how flimsy it was and how ugly it looks in person someone might like it but for 35 nope i normally wear a 2x so it can be loose i ordered a 5x and it is super snug it is so very very thin it seems like it will repel water though and i don t go out often the zipper is weird but works i am returning this i ordered it thinking it would follow the sizing guidelines of other walmart garments i bought it did not it was far too small even though i d gone up a size to account for bulky winter clothes at this price i was not expecting a whole lot but it is incredibly cheaply made the seams aren t finished at all you can see where it has been hastily surged to keep the cheap imitation fur from unraveling for now i m picking pieces of the fluff off my clothing right now and all i did was remove from the package and try it on to call this a winter down coat is laughable there is no down and the coat is so thin that it would be a poor choice even as a windbreaker the quality is so bad that i m surprised walmart would even allow it do not purchase this coat i read the reviews and almost all said not to buy it but i thought by ordering a 5x it would definitely have to fit but no it did not and the colors are not as vibrant as i had hoped they would be please do not waste your money when this jacket i use that term loosely arrived the first thing i noticed was a strong fishy order when i opened the plastic bag the next thing i noticed was this is not a coat i would say this is most certainly a flimsy at best fall hiking jacket but thinner super disappointed with this purchase so i am returning to walmart i absolutely do not recommend this item definitely not a coat at least it fits which means i m luckier than some of the other reviewers but no way is this a winter down coat it s a lightweight coat with fleece inside very poorly constructed with cheap materials 5xl ordered lucky if it s a 1 xl don t want to go thru hassle of returning will donate might be used best for scraps so many things this is the crappiest winter downcoat n n1 very thin material n2 ordered 2x but its a large at best n3 yes there is a fur lining but its so thin id say it was road kill this is a very thin jacket fleece lined and if there s any down in it i have no idea where poor stitching ordered a 3xl it fits like a large very disappointed runs super small i m a extra large and since i purchased other women s tops i knew it would run small but i order a 4x and it s snug also it s a jacket not a coat the coat is much thinner than i expected it to be but i am happy with my purchase as the coat is so beautiful i hope that it is warm during the winter months nthank you nkat cheap quality runs at least 3 sizes smaller than size stated i ordered a 5x because i wear a 2x and my daughter in law who wears a 1x could not get it on what can you expect from china terrible sizing due to being made in a foreign country 5x fits like a 2x coat is very light weight i would not recommend buying bad pricing for the value and the sizing is horrible i wish i had read reviews before buying i wear a 3x and ordered 4x and it is an extra large at best i don t even think a 6x would fit returning is such a hassle had i known this item was coming from china i would have never purchased too thin for a coat doubt i ll ever wear it also it took longer than any other item i purchased ordered xl it fit my 8 year old granddaughter and sleeve was sewn on upside down this was the biggest piece of junk i have ever bought from wal mart com and will never buy another piece of clothing from here this is not a winter coat there is no down in it at all it would probably be ok for spring or fall thin and light weight but warm beautiful fit and so cute you could wear this all day easy movement size up one size for perfect fit very thin material more like a rain coat also smaller than id hoped colors are pretty,women's clothing,0

expected buy the shirt ridiculously soft it s an ok cheaply made shirt poor quality this top is perfect good buy buy this shrunk a lot after first wash pair with leggings cute top,okay walmart i need you to stock these in all the colors and sizes because i need more i love this sweatshirt i wanted to get the green first to try i m 5 3 125lbs and right in between a small and medium my 00 friend has a small and it fits her perfect so i figured i d need a medium out of stock noooo well i got a small it fits perfectly i have length in the sleeves and it is a loose fit i m definitely going to hang dry though n ni love the look and feel of this top it s light but not thin it feels like that atheltic type material mixed with cotton silky soft the olive color is gorgeous for fall also it has some good stretch to it it looks very nice on it has side slits the back is longer than the front and it covers the bottom we love that and the thumb holes bonus n nwhen looking at tops on walmart s site i noticed quite a few times where the first product photo is a little shadowed making the color of the clothing item appear darker but if you scroll and see the other photos you ll see a more acurate representation anyway i definitely recommend this top it s cute casual and pairs well with jeans leggings or joggers bought the black in a sm has a little extra room but good fit i ll wear a tank underneath but u dont have to gr8 for over yoga clothes lounge wear or w jeans luv thumb holes perfect for florida weather i grabbed the last x small in pink heather i think it will work and the wine looking color in a small i d get 1 in every color but i have plenty of shirts with thumb holes hoping it washes well not sure if it s the material that gets little balls on it but i have a device to get them off if that happens for the price i d said go ahead and grab in ur normal size dont think i ll be disappointed i absolutely love this long sleeve t shirt it is amazingly soft im 5 02 and 140 lbs i initially ordered my usual medium for the burgundy and black colors and a small in the gray the burgundy fit perfect but the black one seemed a little big since the small size in gray fit nicely i reordered the black in a small either way im very happy with the purchase 5 stars all the way thanks walmart love this shirt its soft not overly clingy and able to breathe worn at 68 70 degrees and very comfortable i bought the large and it runs tts with the raglan sleeves it feels generous but i like the thumbholes in this shirt for biking i bought this in the store and immediately went online to find more colors so soft love the thumb holes perfect for before or after workouts they seem like they are comparable to higher end brands the comfort and fit are amazing i dislike my stomach area because it s pudgy and i m short this shirt covers it perfectly i m so excited to wear this through fall and winter this year it s very soft and i love the thumb holes i used to cut thumb holes in my shirts and sweaters 15 years ago in middle school and junior high these are much nicer and sewn haha walmart is stepping up their game i was hesitant to purchase this long sleeve shirt and i solely did because at how soft it was i was in love as soon as i put it on the way it hangs i bought my normal size is perfection i also received so many comments about how cute it is and ladies asking where i bought it walmart 12 bucks done boom ni ve even gone back to purchase four more colors no shame it s great to lounge around in or dress it up with jeans this long sleeve t shirt is very thin and ridiculously soft i only wish it were a few inches longer if i wear it with leggings i have to wear a longer top underneath for added length i am not crazy tall 5 7 either the length didn t deter me due to how comfortable it is it s a good purchase overall it is a nice comfortable shirt the only thing that i didn t like is that it pills very easy and after a few delicate washes it is no longer comfortable and has to be de pilled every time i wear it not the same quality as the same size and brand i already had material was thinner and neck looked out of shape before even washing my original avia was made in jordan and this one is made in china poor quality returned to walmart i bought a navy blue one in my local store and i loved it so much i hopped online to purchase the royal blue one these are so soft wash great i do hang to dry and they fit perfect the xl fits me perfectly and i m a 14 16 in most clothes got a large usually wear a medium but fit is perfect to what i wanted love this shirt its warm and comfortable i bought almost all the colors this is a fabulous top comfy washes well looks great looks as if it costs way more this shirt is so soft and comfortable i got another one in a different color i plan on wearing them all season long so comfortable and long enough with leggings bought a large for an oversized look but definitely could ve done a medium very soft very comfortable loose fitting without being baggy long enough to wear with leggings and feel covered very soft and comfortable and it is true to size has thumb holes which i didn t realize at first and i love it it was soft and stretchy then i washed it and it shrunk a lot now it doesn t fit i recommend buying at least 2 sizes up from your regular size goes great with leggings you look stylish and comfortable at the same time really soft and fits great slight high low hem is flattering and legging friendly,women's clothing,0

615,Maidenform Flexees Cool Comfort Firm Wirefree Camisole,19.94,4.5,206.0,best lifting and slimming camisole ever the perfect slimming camisole amazing camisole great fit love the fit quality and price it should be called a miracle bra amazing product nice and comfortable great buy put this on by stepping into it very comfortable best shaping cami ever my choice glad i purchased this camisole great value will buy again true to size great,this is the most amazing thing ever it is not only slimming with great support but it is comfortable and makes you want to wear it every day i love that they have made these with a built in bra i have always worn maidenform but adding in the bra without the wire was genius i was iffy about buying these and was worried if the cups would fit me because i am bustier or if it would give enough support after reading the reviews i decided to go ahead and buy it i am so glad i did because it is perfect it gives the me the perfect lift and sexiness of an expensive bra i love the slimming support and the fact that the bra is built in this is my go to undergarmet to add extra support to my abdomen i wear it under gym shirts and for everyday i hope you never stop making these i have finally ordered my second one i found the first one in the store but for some reason walmart never keeps a good thing stocked let alone anything that i really need for some reason but im glad i could still order it i ve been using this camisole for years now cannot go without using it for too long i m 180 pounds and i wear a size medium to help me with the boob lift effect nlove it highly recommend it this is my second one and i m very pleased with it it fits very well smoothes the tummy and no underwire i love wearing these instead of a regular bra so much more comfortable and it holds everything in place with no slipping i have been looking to replace an older version of this maidenform product but they were always too short i like to keep the smooth look beyond my waistline and this suits my needs perfectly i m also trying to get support without underwire plus this undergarment is very reasonably priced i plan to get several more why did i not know about this before now i hate bras because there is no such thing as a comfortable bra the underwires stick and the wireless bras squeeze these are perfect i feel like i am cheating and not wearing a bra at all i know i am way too excited about this but this is a game changer i love that it smooths out my tummy and no uni boob no underarm boob and back rolls it s a miracle these are the best things ever invented i have always worn maidenform and now these have taken them to a whole new level now i can wear them without a bra and they fit just as well as an expensive bra without having the discomfort of wearing one love these and will continue to buy i have bought tons i love this it fits well and is very comfortable the only issue i have is trying to pull up your pants over it it tends to roll up so you have to smooth it down it takes you a bit longer in the restroom to get it all smoothed but something you can wear all day and feel great love these wire free camisoles they are so comfortable and they help to hold in and slim down your waist line i have three of them at first i wasn t sure about buying them online if they would have the support i needed 40d but they do i am 5 1 155 lbs and apple shaped i bought a 2xl i am sooo happy with my purchase my pants usually roll under my tummy and leave gigantic muffin tops this shaper smooths out the muffin top but the thing i like most is my pants stay at my waist and no longer roll under my tummy i thought i would feel like a sausage i it but it feels smooth and more comfortable than without it please try it you will be surprised love these comfortable fabulous fit i wear a 36 d and the large fits perfectly important tip put this on by stepping into it and pulling up from the bottom it s close to impossible to put this on like a shirt i wear this under my shirts in place of my reg bras it s much more comfortable the molded cups and shaping are much better for larger breasted women the perfect shaping cami i wear this over a bra and it gives me an uplifted bustline again nice and long which keeps it from rolling i love it i bought four i like the comfort it doesn t make my back hurt the long line also keeps all my bumps and rolls in control giving a much better appearance and fit of clothing very smoothing and looks great the breast pockets are bigger than expected fits well and makes a great appearance when tops are added have not tested it for summer heat but it definitely would seem to be uncomfortable after wearing it awhile it is easier to pull on than when new i love these camis but had to return mine which is sad because i was so looking forward to ditching my bra so the compression is great and it keeps everything tucked in it s a little tricky getting it on and off but once it s on it s fine there s just one problem the bra portion of the cami is definitely not for the smaller bossom y i wear anywhere between a 16 and 20 and got the camisole in a 2x my bra cup size is a small d large c there was no way i could fill out the camisole s cups and since it was too large for me the cups developed this weird and embarrassing crease these camis really are the best but just keep in mind the bra cups might not fit i returned mine and bought the flexees camisole without the molded bra it worked out much better for me good compression without feeling like a sausage and the bra doesnt squash your boobs like other camisoles i bought this to take on a cruise for support while wearing tee shirts it was fantastic the fabric did not bunch and stayed in place once i returned

618,"No Boundaries Juniors' Christmas Ankle Leggings, 2-Pack",8.88,3.0,13.0,why all the negative reviews leggings fit well and wash inside and hang to dry cheapy cheap i wish they were softer smelly cheaply made ew,i am confused by all the negative reviews these are the same 4 holiday leggings i have been buying for years they are mostly cotton and not scratchy or tight at all i always buy them a size up because they are juniors brand the smaller size would have fit as well yes they aren t as soft as the halloween leggings they had this year but they are the exact same as every other pair i ve bought for years i have been looking for hanukkah leggings for years to no avail so i am so excited to find these and the best part is that they are not just the same boring hanukkah pattern of star of david s but actually have a wide variety of hanukkah themed graphics such as sufganiyot jelly donuts torah scrolls doves menorahs dreidels etc i love these so much and i plan to purchase another set my family purchased these to wear christmas with matching shirts great price and fit i knew before purchasing that these aren t the soft leggings but i wanted them anyways to add to my christmas legging collection also these are see through and they fade after one wash i really like the flamingo print 8 88 is cheap for 2 pairs of leggings even though they are not as soft as the halloween leggings i will still wear them and use fabric softener when i wash them also the printed ones feel very cheap cute but cheap i bought them for a christmas present and i am still giving them to that person but i wish they were softer cute but cheap material also they smell bad kinda like gasoline i really like the flamingo print 8 88 is cheap for 2 pairs of leggings they feel very cheap not soft leggings at all really tight and uncomfortable these aren t the soft suede leggings,women's clothing,0
619,"Just My Size Womens Plus Size comfort shaping jacquard wire free bra, style 1Q20",13.46,4.2,2558.0,beautiful bra th best bra i ve ever bought best fit for me no wires spillage the seams why runs way small unhappy with this bra way way too small disappointing way too small what a disappointment for me it is eh makes me feel beautiful could be better great bra 4 out of 5 fit correctly how well they fit worst purchase ever plus size bra review great fit sizing weird,beautiful bra the material is so soft and the straps are wide and thick good quality recieved it before the projected shipping date i m very satisfied thus far i absolutely love this bra and this style it is the only one i will wear i am so glad i found where i can order online and will definitely be a repeat customer this bra is comfortable and pretty most importantly it s the only style bra that fits me well i had a breast lift and reduction after losing 200 pounds whatever size the surgeon gave me nothing i tried on would fit finally i found this bra i ve been wearing this bra since 2003 i put one of the 3 ordered as soon as i received them and instantly loved the fit and full coverage no top spillage or side action my only reason for not giving 5 stars is i would prefer some sort of strap protection like gel pad hopefully having the proper size the gel protection will not be missed no digging in shoulders thus far best part is the instant look of reduction without surgery and back roll coverage this is such a pretty and mostly confortable bra but why oh why are the seams down the middle itchy itchy nipples i said it were there any women involved in the design description said runs small which is an understatement so i ordered a larger size and still too small very frustrating that every brand of bra has changed their sizing and not uniformly this is a pretty bra and if you can find your size you should like it straps are too thin not much support for the full busted and the straps slip all day long i adjusted the straps to be snug and that didn t help apparently they loosen on their own if you have very firm breasts then maybe you would like the bra it is pretty and soft just not suitable for large busted ladies i am not sure who they made this bra for but it does not fit an average woman i put the arm straps as far down as they would go and i still barely made it into the bra it rode up so far in the back i was wondering if it could be a necklace the seams on the front of the bra what the heck you can not wear it under a tshirt unless you want weird lines all over and the material is thin thin thin if you dont mind having your nipples poke out with a tiny bit of wind than this is the bra for you i ordered the size that the accompanying size guide specified for me it was a 40 d i wondered if that could be correct since i haven t worn that small a cup size since i was 17 however foolish me i ordered what was specified wrong n nthis bra was waaaaay too small in the cup the band cut into me so badly i couldn t keep it on for very long and the straps are horribly uncomfortable nothing in this bra stretched as advertised n nnot only is it not just my size but it is also rather cheaply made and uncomfortable i know i ve n nsaid that already but can t stress it enough uncomfortable n ni would not recommend buying this bra the sizing was nowhere near accurate i ordered two of another brand in the same size and they fit perfectly the jms were seriously too small trying to decide if it s worth the trouble returning them i won t order any more of their brand that s for sure the size is correct but although the straps dont fall down all the time they need to be adjusted more often than what i want also the underwire seems to be more flimsy than other bras i didnt return it but if i had more bras i probably would have being a larger woman i have a hard time finding a great bra that fits and is comfortable and also affordable that s why i m glad i learned of just my size bras i have a few of their bras my favorite the front closure ones but i bought a couple of the leopard sort of print because i wanted something that was a little more pretty these bras are very comfortable and i love that they are wirefree i also like that they are pretty and make me feel better about myself wearing it product had a default instead of four hooks it only has 3 this made it uncomfortable as a crossdresser i love how this bra feels i just wish i could get more of them i purchased 5 bras all same style jms satin stretch wirefree and size however the rose colored one fit smaller the two white and two black fit correctly but that one did not i really love my 3 bras they fit very well without a wire i am a 40d but since the pandemic i just decided to order one of them a size 42d glad i did it s comfortable although i still can fit the 40d this bra is horrible itchy uncomfortable and cheap the straps are have no give which add to the discomfort of this horrible garment if i could 0 stars i would i love that the bras fit the way they should it took a very long time for them to arrive considering they were coming from within the united states when they arrived the fit was perfect i did have a problem with the material of one of them my favorite one the stitch where the hooks are was not sewed and was hanging off i chose not to return it as it is my favorite and i can run some stitches through it myself except for the one bra out of 4 not being sewed securely i would rate it a 3 5 the bras themselves were perfect except for the 1 flaw in 1 bra between the broken seem and the long delivery time i would say 3 5 been buying these for years cool comfortable i only wish there was a little more support and i wish you had bras just like these with no seam down the middle as it shows through many solid shirts but overall it is all i wear all other bras have too much padding and i am already large enough i used the online size calculator which was way off the fabric and seams are not soft or comfortable especially since the seaming cuts right through the center of the most delicate part of the breast it is well made and pretty though just totally unwearable for me,women's clothing,0

631,EV1 from Ellen DeGeneres Metallic Cuff Alex Relaxed Jean Women's,13.0,4.6,367.0,great buy great buy quality comfortable jeans great stretch comfy jeans adorable best jeans ever great buy amazing super comfy with one problem not for me hugs your body with stretch but no give too big great comfy jeans cute comfortable red jeans great price love ev1 jeans jusst only pros no cons perfect distressed boyfriend jeans,i like it i like it the comfort quality and style are all there in these jeans sorry i m so late with this review but i ve been having some health issues i m so thankful to our wonderful lord that he is helping cope with my health problems just love these jeans they are definitely on my top 5 pairs of jeans they have great stretch that doesn t get out of shape within a few hours i own about 6 pairs of these jeans and i would say they fit as expected these are so stylish and cute fit is true to size perfect to wear with an ankle boot they are capri length i absolutely love them i gained some weight after baby and kinda settled with that but recently because stress i lost about 15 lbs and wanted to ditch the yoga pants after 3 4 years hiding in the so i saw those jeans online a while ago and didn t think much about them i was thinking that they are very expensive for walmart quality i was hesitant because i really like to try on pants before i buy i read all the reviews and went with what i thought was the right size they turned out absolutely fantastic i feel like they are basically true to size but they have a very relaxed fit my problem is always the waist being too tight as i am not very curvy more straight these were fantastic and have just the right amount of stretch i haven t worn them out all day yet so i can t speak to how much they will stretch out over the course of the day just a little at the house and they are my favorite jeans i got the ones with the camo stripe very cute and it s a subtle muted print i wear anywhere between a 12 and 14 the 14 is mainly because of the waistline i might could have worn a 12 but i really like the 14s because they have a truer boyfriend fit and the length i am 5 8 and 1 2 and they are long enough on me i like my boyfriend jeans to be long enough that i can cuff them and they hit right above my ankle these are perfect this is my third pair of jeans from the ev1 collection they are the best jeans because of the comfort and the stretch aspect i love this style and wash very simple and stylish the fabric behind the ripped area on the knee is coming out already while i can fix it because i have a sewing machine not everyone will be able to do that you could just tear the binding fabric off and leave the jean material ripped but the rip will certainly get bigger fast and may not be desirable i bought these on clearance but little did i know you can t return items bought on clearance these just didn t fit well they were supposed to be a relaxed fit but were more like leggings i don t wear leggings because they do not flatter my figure these might have been alright for someone else but just not for me extremely comfortable and stylish at the same time love the fit and look i am small waisted with healthy thighs and bottom i ordered a size 8 and they fit perfectly they hug my natural body shape so i have no gap in my waistline and no sag in my bottom even after 13 hours of wearing them too relaxed very big in the hip and leg area i love these distress jean s i bought one pair and they fit perfect so i bought a 2nd pair definitely would buy more when they have my size in the other colors the picture wasn t quite as described the jeans are loose so i would probably recommend a size down just in case you don t want them to be loose they are comfortable but a little long as i am only 5 1 i wish they would come in petite sizes but overall they are worth the they have some stretch and cute true bright red color not wine but red super comfortable and can roll down cuff if dont want cropped look cropped look they have is not too short can be unattractive for legs i just love ev1 seem very well made for the price ive had expensive jeans and these are just as good and i think better cause of the little stretch in them i love the color and the stretch of material my only complaint is that both of the back pockets have rips in them i know it s intentional to give a slight distressed look however i m not a fan of buying new jeans with tears in them n ni haven t washed them yet so i hope the rips don t get worse i will have to wash in gentle cycle n nthey are very soft and pretty so i give them 4 out of 5 thank you i love ev1 jeans have stretch after pig out on lunch and if cuffed for the cropped type style can unroll it if want longer jeans and u just cant beat the price for the style who would guess wearing walmart jeans love them and right on trend point just enough ripped up spots these jeans fits really good so comfortable and relaxing on the skin flexible when moving around easy to care i wash and dry simple these jeans fit well and are soft they are the right length i like the light color for summer i was very pleased that they don t have a strange odor as some of the bleached jeans do my favorite jeans period they re so comfortable i don t want to give them up even though i ve lost weight and have dropped a size so i m belting them to keep wearing as long as possible will buy the next size down soon,women's clothing,1

634,Time and Tru Women's Long Sleeve Faux Wrap Dress,9.98,4.2,157.0,love the dress nice dress i want more of these gorgeous dress very nice light summery dress this is great wrap dress for price fee fi faux fabulous nice straightforward styling nice fabric not true size i bought one then bought four more fits smaller than expected very flattering such a nice dress needs some elastic in the waist cute dress great dress and great price not a good wrap one amazing dress no,i love this dress it was soft and comfortable the buttons were put on the right location so the dress can fit appropriately the waist belt is very stylish i got the one that went on sale in the store a navy floral i love it i m a short thick girl and it was flattering because the hem is a little higher in the front due to the wrap it didn t hit at that weird frumpy length material was nice and heavy enough to help it hang properly but not too hot also for ladies with bigger arms it has no stretch but it fit my arms which it s usually a problem for me with this type of fabric i m 5 2 185 190 lbs and wore the l i will probably order an xl in other colors but the l certainly felt and looked fine i purchased this wrap dress in the store in the color dark floral on impulse i didn t try it on i just picked my size i expected to need to return it but i m going to keep it it is fabulous it s true to size because of the wrap style it would be fine if i lost or gained a bit of weight and since my weight fluctuates often i really appreciate the style the pattern is soft summer a slightly grayed navy back ground it has several buttons and snaps so that you feel secure against wardrobe malfunctions it is the perfect below the knee mid calf length that i love the fabric is fine i do prefer a natural fabric but for a 20 dress it s the best that we can expect i haven t washed it yet but i plan to wash it in the machine in a laundry bag on delicate and hang to dry it should be fine all in all perfect dress i hope they make more patterns and colors i would love to have one in solid black as well very versatile for size reference i m 5 5 my shoulders are very wide 17 inches from shoulder to shoulder my shoulders are my widest measurement i vary between 130 and 180 lbs this is a surprisingly well made walmart find thank you for everyone s reviews who convinced me the construction and fabric is very similar a j c rew dress i have i wouldn t be embarrassed to wear this to work the length is good and it s a nice polyester crepe not a low quality knit absolutely beautiful dress flows nicely perfect knee length long enough arms with a bit of a balloon sleeve there are 3 hidden buttons all in the right places to make the wrap work material is not super breathable so might be best for spring or fall this is a very nice dress the sleeves can be rolled up to give it a more casual look most summer dresses like this have so much fabric this is more streamlined but still light and summery looking it is true to size i am normally a size 6 and a small fit well this is great wrap dress for the price i got the navy floral in the store on clearance rack of walmart in march or april 2020 for five dollars and thirty nine cents 5 39 this dress is cute it is comfortable and cheap i got it in size small which is size 4 6 i loved style and fit so much i decided order it online i want it in black red baby pink and lavender color it is kind dress you can wear to work it is business appropriate but still sexy classy and elegant this looks really good for a casual comfortable dress the construction and fabric is quality it is not a faux wrap it is a real wrap washable too many great things about this dress very flattering cut lots of good color options i have not worn mine out of the house yet so i can t tell you if the wrap part of the skirt will blow open but i will probably pin it shut just to be safe i am either a l or xl and in this dress i chose a l and it fit well i am pear shaped with small bust it is a lightweight fabric really nice for summer i was surprised because i read is polyester the only problem i have is that run small i order a 3x because of my arms and i also knew that fabric won t stretch it felt a little tight in the arms but to my surprise no even close to wrapping me around i usually wear x2 but that is not the true size those dresses are for junior size which is totally different from women s sizes this dress looks like it could be from banana republic not walmart no shade at walmart the fabric hangs beautifully and the wrap style is super flattering i originally only bought the lavender shade but when it arrived and i tried it on i knew this dress would become part of my go to work wardrobe and so i immediately bought the same dress in four more colors as a note the lighter colors are a bit sheer so i would suggest a nude slip underneath and being cautious about which undergarments you choose to wear the dress is nice feels good and is comfortable it was a little tight across the chest area so it will be returned but otherwise it was a great fit i bought the same size i usually wear with this brand so the fact it didn t fit was a surprise can t go wrong with this wrap dress this is very flattering on the two inner buttons and snap keep everything in place and the ties tie into a nice side bow im 5 7 117lbs and found the xs too snug in the chest and across the back the s is a much better fit i love the red light and bright pink which accessorizes perfectly with turquois jewelry this dress is super cute and extremely flattering i am only 5 feet and the dress comes down to my ankles but i actually like that it is longer on me the color is nice and the pattern on it is very elegant i really like the material it does not stick to your body and it feels cool and smooth i have fuller hips and this dress compliments them very nicely there is a small button on the chest is a nice touch to help with cleavage if the waist on this dress had been elasticized at all it would have been perfect cute comfortable lightweight dress fits true to size the quality was surprisingly good good length enough space all over to feel comfortable ended up buying the pink and the black wish they had some different patterns very flattering dress the arms are so long and the material is scratchy missed the return window and stuck with this dress the torso is wide and the material feels hot during summer this just arrived yesterday and i tried it on immediately i m obsessed the material is wonderul with a lovely bright color exactly as pictured no stretch to it at all so get your proper size i found it to be tts i was worried it would be too long for me i m fairly short at 5 3 ish but it s wonderful if i had to make a complaint and this is so super minor it would be that one of the buttons to fasten the dress is directly under my left breast so it s hard to see and therefore fasten but i just used the mirror to guide me and i got it after a couple attempts i bought this based off the pictures of other people wearing this in reviews didn t look too bad this was horrible for me ran way too small the buttons and snaps were annoying as crap to get on and it looked so frumpy didn t like the material either was an instant return,women's clothing,0

comfort and quality perfect stretch and fit fits in both the hips and the waistline perfect for my plus sized curves perfect fit for my curves the best black jeans ever awesome jeans,nice jeans nice stretch good size and length im five foot 8 inches ordered the long lenght and no ankles showing yay lee cooper whats not to like i wear them few times a week all day long and they don t get stretched out and loose keep there dark color very well also so glad lee still makes them thank you i had a lot of trouble finding my jeans in any of the stores within a 3 hour radius of my home i went on line and tried a couple of different lee jeans and finally found the ones that fit the best and were most comfortable i will continue to purchase these jeans they are worth the price and there are usually sales and discounts and have not found any other brands to fit as well it was getting frustrating to be searching and returning so many products until finding the ones on the lee website i love the way they fit and feel good quality and comfortable lee leans are my favorite have not had a bad pair buy with confidence i am both tall and heavy set so it s difficult to find jeans that fit these lee jeans are perfect stretchy and comfortable perfect fit for me i ca not go wrong with lee jean s i love the fit and look feels great comfortable lee is my go to brand for jeans or slack pants besides fit and comfort lee remembered the importance of functional pockets being tall it s hard to find jeans that don t look like floods being a bit older it s also important to have room in the waist i have just one issue with the 18w tall jeans i bought they don t come with the comfort waistband that they used to i have 18w tall jeans i purchased last year and they have a wide black on the inside waistband with sayings like you are strong you are talented i don t really need the platitudes but i do need that comfort waistband please bring it back one more thing the dark jeans are super dark be aware of that when you order i haven t bought a pair of lee jeans for ages as i live in arizona and it s usually too hot for jeans but these are a good lightweight jeans for winter here the fit is great and i like the soft stretch fabric definitely getting another pair soon i was and am so disappointed with these jeans i ve been buying these jeans for about 6 years now and have several pair of the old relaxed fit this time i got the new relaxed fit thinking by new they meant better i could never be more wrong these are not even the same color they are very thin and the dye job is awful making them appear as though they have stripes across the area between the waist and hip area i took a pic of both side by side the pair on the left are about 3 years old and have been through the washer close to 100 times the pair on the right have been washed once and were purchase back in august they are supposed to be the same color but are far from being anything close i would have sent them back but needed a pair of jeans for a certain occasion and didn t have enough time to wait since my shirt was going to cover the stripes i didn t let them bother me one of my main reasons for buying the old relaxed fit was because i have severe psoriasis covering both legs and lee old relaxed fit in tall are the only pants that don t irritate my skin i can hardly wait for the old relaxed jeans to come back in 2017 i ll be checking in often and will definitely stock up this time this is the second pair i have bought for work and i love them they give me the comfort i need to bend stretch etc at work i liked the fit through the hip and legs but the pants run big in the waist i had to make the waist smaller by running elastic through the waist band wish jean makers wouldn t always make the waist so big women are not made straight up and down i always order tall length the length is a little bit shorter on these than my other lee jeans they will do but just wish they were about an inch longer otherwise i like them i was afraid to order jeans online but since covid i don t go in the stores and try on cloths i ordered my usual size i m 5 9 so i selected the long version better longer than too short i was happy i did they fit very well they are comfortable jeans and very good quality i ve already purchased another pair love these jeans fabric is a light weight denim with a wonderful amount of stretch built in i am 5ft 4 in and this is the perfect length i loved the jeans so much that i ordered another love these jeans full enough to fit my full hips yet not have the usual 4 gap in the waist perfect fit and great comfortable feel finally a pair of jeans i don t have to alter before i can wear them i ve been buying lee jeans for over 10 years from the first time i tried on lee jeans and purchased them to now i have always been happy with the fit and cut also the length is perfect and they never shrink and shorten up over time i currently wear a plus size but if i ever get back to women s sizes i will still wear lees regardless of what size i may be i know that these jeans will always fit my waist and curvy hips just right i love how these fit my curves without too much fabric i have had plus size jeans that worked but seemed to always have a bunch of extra fabric in the areas of the curves such as the stomach area lee found nice material that is not too thick or too thin with just enough stretch to fit my curves and flatter my shape the material colors are classy and trendy i found the recommended sizes to be too big so i must not know how to measure myself but with free shipping both ways it was convenient to send back the wrong size the price alerts are great as i will buy more in a smaller size for summer when the price drops again i need bigger size for winter so i can wear long johns underneath i like the straigh leg as i am tired of the skinny jean sometimes too restricting as well as the boot cut sometimes too baggy and drafty on my legs in the winter i have been a lee customer for many years i work in a business casual environment so black jeans are allowed i where them every day with different tops of course but at one point lee stopped making the black jeans that i have been buying for years and years i was so disappointed but finally they have returned and i have stocked up on them what do i love the most about these jeans two things one is that they come in a longer length not talls but longer 33 and the second thing is the belt loops yup i said belt loops they are place strategically and generously around the waist so your belt stays in place i still have 9 more years to work and i m begging lee to never get rid of these jeans again i simply love them i love these jeans because they come in long plus they have a little stretch in them and will not bust at the seams they look good come in a few colors i get a little upset about the price but all in all the jeans are very good product wash well,women's clothing,0
637,Women's Classic Career Shirt,14.96,4.6,262.0,yes great shirt easy care and comfortable very nice for the price this a good product no iron shirt hard to believe this is from walmart good shirt for the office or catering floor a definite must buy nice blouse chest runs small ok but fabric may be not comfortable hot weather you need this every day work shirt favorite work shirt love this shirt very nice blouse of great quality and comfort fit perfect work shirt a quality made perfect,i had to return and go a size down because it was way too big but once i got a smaller size i was really impressed i am normally a medium and after reading all the reviews i thought i would get a large that was a mistake and i had to return them and go down a size this is a great wardrobe essential the fit is nice i like the stretch for comfort and the best part is it is very easy care i washed and dried it and it went straight to my closet no ironing i m 5 7 160 lbs i got a large and i have room but not sloppy looks and descriptions of items can be very deceiving as well as disappointing ni can honestly confirm that this is not one of those items that you always have to return nthis blouse is beautiful nthe collar as well as the cuffs at the wrists are just two of the contributing factors that give this blouse such a nflattering and elegant appeal nthis blouse can be worn for work casually out for the evening and even formally ni am very very pleased nwith my blouse nwhen i tried it on and look in the mirror i was very amazed at how it fit me as well as how charming it made me feel nso very nice for the price this is a great buy i am pleased with the fit the fabric is soft and comfortable but still sturdy the shirt comes in three colors i am hoping for more choices no iron shirt with a crepe like material with a dressier feel that gives when you move i ll be buying more classic tailored fit not the softest fabric but well structured and thick perfect for elevating a pair of jeans i purchased this shirt in a size up to wear for pitching in to plate dinners at a wedding but i really could have worn my regular size and been fine i got a bigger size so i would not flash any skin as i hustled and moved but the shirt is long enough and has ample stretch to avoid that issue it is wash and wear does not wrinkle and should take an embroidered logo well for people who are shopping for company uniform shirts this really does compare to shirts i had to purchase for a professional firm that required business uniforms on certain days and i ordered those shirts from a famous and somewhat expensive catalog company one thing this shirt has that those do not is an invisible hooter hider snap in the button placket right where a large bust would stretch open the placket love that the fabric is not at all cotton y and it feels a little like windbreaker material so it would probably not be good for business formal attire but business dress and business casual would be just fine i see my local stores are running low on this item and i hope that does not mean walmart is doing away with it people in entry level positions need reliable workwear at affordable prices and i know this would have filled the bill for me had it been available back in my struggling younger days i bought 2 of these blouses they fit true to size have a slight stretch to them which i like material is great and not flimsy and the beauty of these is they wash and dry well and no wrinkles i highly suggest these thanks walmart good job on these this is a very very nice blouse very well made and sewn w flattering princess seems so does a very tailored look my only complaint disappointment was that the bust seemed to be smaller than it should have been i was so disappointed to have to send it back b c the chest was just to small i tried to look for the type of fabric that it was made of and i couldn t find it it is polyester and spandex it looks fine good quality but if you want this for comfortability it may not be the best option for high temperature weathers or even outside during summer in not so hot places size was accurate and it looks really nice it has a shine to it it s not just black one of the best tops i have bought online in years i came back and bought another one they are slightly fitted but not too tight stain resistant wrinkle free for the most part washes very well and keeps it s shape and black color bonus is the hidden breast snap that perfectly prevents gaps thicker material hard to get the initial creases out of the shirt but once you do it washes well i hang dry i am between a large and extra large i ordered the extra large and it fits perfect the xl is longer in the body i am long waisted and need the extra length i have these in blue white and black very comfortable looks like a tailored classic costing small amount of spandex keeps it looking sharp has adjustable button on the cuff for smaller wrist looks great great quality blouse the fit is great and doesnt wrinkle as bad as some of my cotton blouses i have had compliments on the two i own just wish they had more colors especially red and yellow i would order one in every color i have 2 of these work shirts already so i ordered some more the material and fit is perfect for my day at work it has stretch to it easy to wash and iron okay in a pinch but is 100 polyester which makes is look as cheap as it is and it s hot definitely not a summer shirt perhaps okay under a jacket or sweater love that is fitted the fabric is very nice crisp can wear it alone or over a short sleeve top dress it up with jewelry good value for the money ndelivered in record time in perfect condition nmore than pleased very nice top will buy more if available true to size be sure to order your normal size as this top has stretch i ordered a large and probably could have worn a small in any case still looks ok on but too big i will order in small next time super cute great quality order your normal time and tru size i m normally a l in time and tru but ordered the xl just to compare the l fit great this is such a nice shirt would love to see more colors,women's

645,Women's Athletic Works Mule Slip On Shoe,14.88,4.5,546.0,old shoes took a beating now have new ones excellent my favorite slip on love them good for hanging out perfect except for the insole decent shoes for the price don t last long sole comes unglued shortly a change shoes get bear traps shoes fall apart great shoes great for me i have bad feet and love these i hope they are always around to buy well made the best comfy shoes would totally recommend for the price annoying insoles dingy even after washing fit the bill,i dont know how they would last for long walks exercise everyday but work great for quick out the door backyard shoes i wear out on wet ground for gardening after a year the bottom sole started coming of so i used shoegoo and back on wash in garden bucket when muddy wanted a new pair to have when i needed so photo is old ones lol i liked everything was fine i like buying these shoes to wear i buy them all the time they are very affordable after they get too dirty i buy a new pair these on my go to shoes for the summer and slip on highly recommended great quality and they last awhile i have diabetic foot issues on my upper inner callus which causes ulcers i am not able to go barefoot anywhere and must always have a shoe on i had been putting my orthotic sneakers on just to use the bathroom in the middle of the night these shoes work i liked them so much that i ordered a pair of black and white and then ordered another pair of each to have when these wear out in case they stop making them i have had several pair of these they are great to wear around the house the only negative is that they stretch out quickly so i buy smaller sizes and take a few days to break them in i normally wear an 8 shoe but on these if i m wearing with sox i use a 7 if i m using without six i wear a 6 5 it s worth the few days to break in because they are comfortable once broken in and they are easy to slip off and on the only thing bad about these shoes is the insole i bought them to throw on when taking my new puppy outside we have a very messy farm with leaves and grass in the early mornings so i wanted something inexpensive and easy to wear although very comfy they are loose and continue to slide around and out of my shoe when walking makes me feel like i will lose the shoe so i was planning on buying another pair but by day 3 unless i can figure a way to keep the insole in the shoe i decided against it really a bummer because otherwise they are great very comfortable and true to size however the memory foam pad is not affixed to the shoe so it moves around fixed mine with a dab of super glue so it would stay in place decent wear around the house shoes for the price love the easy to wear shoes downside the sole comes unglued soon after purchase have returned to walmart hoping manufacturer will get the message no luck i bought these when they were 9 99 they were great when the price went up the quality went down i started to have knee problems purchased just 2 months ago and so disappointed i bought these to keep at the door and slip on when i need to take the dogs out with such little wearing the sole of the shoe has separated completely from the toe it was only glued in and the whole front end flaps up and down with each step that is not the worst part the bottom of the shoe is so thin that when i walk on my gravel driveway i not only feel each rock but some actually push through the bottom of the shoe is like a thick rubbery sponge i really am enjoying these mules true to size and enough room for extra insoles if you desire although there is a memory foam insole in the shoe i wear between an 8 5 and 9 and went with the 9 after trying on a white pair in store the shoes are very soft and cushioned even the upper is cushioned they also have a flattering look the black with black pants looks very put together i also wear mine with pajamas as a good supportive house shoe very happy with this purchase a these shoes are great for me you can wear them barefoot but the insole will come up as it is removeable they are very comfortable and that is why i have two pair of each color they are nnot walking shoes for fitness walking but are great for shopping and around the house and yard i have hammer toes and most shoes are painful these are awesome very comfortable and easy to put on and off i glued the insole in place when i got them but other then that i may get another pair before there all gone in my size i ve worn these all summer so there dirty i have really terrible feet and i have many problems these are the best and most comfortable shoes i have found i wear them gardening walking relaxing at home everywhere these were advertised as mediums i usually wear a wide shoe but took a chance and ordered them anyway they fit they are well made and very comfortable thanks to the padding inside these are the best weigh nothing good support i have foot issues and wear orthotic if on my feet for a really long time but these work for me for short trips and times i m up and down absolutely love these shoes very comfortable i have 5 pairs in various states of use just bought a new pair as they don t last too long but they don t cost too much anyway i will just keep buying them as long as wal mart is smart enough to stock them i am not the only one in my building who wears them also like many others i bought these as quick slip on to keep by the door when taking my dog out or checking the mail i needed something that i could wear in wet dewy grass so a slipper wouldn t do i bought a pair of these about 3 years ago and still wear them to push mow my lawn i bought three this time just in case they are discontinued i don t think i could live without them they start out very comfortable but within a few weeks lose a bit of cushion height worst thing is the memory foam insole is so soft that it bunches up when you slide your foot in and it comes out of the shoe when you bring your foot out also soiled shoes do not come clean in the wash stains and discoloration even from just rain stay giving you freshly washed but still dingy spotted shoes i dislike just wearing socks but don t want to stretch out my slippers by wearing socks with them so i needed a slip on to wear around the house this fall and winter these are a bargain at under 15 and since they don t come in wide widths i got a half size larger so i can wear nice thick warm socks with them n njust what i wanted,women's clothing,0
646,Women's Cable Knit Sweater Ladies Casual Plain Hooded Button Pocket Outwear,40.59,1.2,81.0,disappointed very deceptive definitely not a good purchase nothing like pictured mu biggest online shopping regret read before buying not what you think it is believe the bad reviews why isn t there a zero star option false advertisement not worth the money zero stars do not purchase not as pictured or described sad product,horrible 0 stars not true size and it definitely doesn t look like what is illustrated well the description is very deceptive 1 there is nothing fluffy about this item at all 2 there is nothing knitted nor soft feeling about this item 3 fits funny on the body 4 would not call this a winter coat unless its in a southern state not warm enough to be called a coat where i live but it looks knitted and would make a nice layering piece this is the cheapest jacket i wouldn t call it a coat it came yesterday and i was so unhappy with it that i didn t even try it on definitely not a quality buy looks like it was made with paper even though the picture makes it looks plush i don t think that it even deserves 1 star terrible quality and not even close to a coat or jacket it s more similar to a sweater poorly made sewn awkwardly and super short nothing like pictured very disappointed and will be returning horrible sewing material is cheap polyester not even remotely close to the picture we see here i regret so much buying it doesnt even have a tag to know where it came from size is completely wrong sleeves are ridiculously long ni would never recommend it i hope i can return it and get my money back what i got in the mail compared to the picture is completely different the picture shows a coat but it is a sweater i ordered a 2x and it is not fitting like a 2x it is fitting like and xl there is no fur and the arms are too tight and short tho what i got is beautiful it is not worth the amount spent when i ordered thid item this was the listing for it wodstyle womens winter coat ladies fleece fluffy fur hooded jacket outwear plus size there is no fur in this this is basically a hoodie i see that the description ha now been adjusted this is not a 40 product i may have paid 20 extremely unhappy how can they just change the listing without letting the buyer know that it was listed incorrectly so i was hoping the bad reviews were just due to the bad sizing i ordered a 5x normally wear a 2x it is oddly short and the arms are wide and too long more importantly it s not even a jacket let alone a winter coat it s unfinished just the shell not a cozy warm sweater no lining no fleece and no fur it s simply incomplete and i m definitely returning and am very disappointed do not order the seams were coming undone right out of the package it is absolutely not fur lined it s actually lined with the most scratchy uncomfortable fabric i ve ever felt in my entire life the shape of it made me look like a pregnant hog and just for reference i am neither of those things i cannot say enough horrible terrible things to describe this piece of 40 trash so i ll just end with the fact that i hate everything about this sweater horrible quality and nothing like the picture no fleece like description says just a polyester shirt size completely wrong ran an about 3 sizes too small cute in picture not at all what i expected it s cute but not i expected seriously want to return disappointing to wait for delivery and to be disappointed i would never spend the money on this if i had known it was made like garbage it is not worth the money instead of returning it i gave it to a kid to play dress up with this product is a cheap thin rough piece of fabric it was delivered in a very small bag and was so waded up couldn t tell what it was at first i am returning it to walmart if i could give it zero stars i would it is not lined in anyway could be cute if it wasn t skin tight and didn t have half inch visible seams i should have read the reviews before purchasing this was cute but is far from a winter coat very thin the size runs very small i will most likely keep it but wear it as a sweater definetly not a winter coat very disappointing and picture is misleading poor quality i ordered 2 different jackets from this company and both made cheap i wish i would have read reviews first not cable knit sweater just raised pattern on fabric it is not lined and no fleece in the hood it is thinner than a sweatshirt not outterwear and sizes are crazy check the chart 4x is size 12 us i returned it horrible item i am not a picky person but i paid 40 for this item and its very cheap material and ordered in my true size and its 3 sizes to small material was cheap and itchy this was a 10 jacket not a 40 jacket if i could pick no starts i would it is just a quilted liner no fur lined anything sizes run very small came in a bag that fit in my apt mailbox do not purchase not a true to size item i ordered a 3x and it mightve been a size l very unhappy sending the very light weight jacket back it is not a coat only a very light jacket,women's clothing,0
647,Women's Lowcut Socks 10 Pack,12.41,4.0,101.0,absolutely loved them honest not too thick or thin heavy weight but comfy defective material more polyester than cotton great quality i love hanes socks but not the right size in love with your socks super socks great socks not what expected but work they shrunk comfy good socks good,although not for me my mother who received them as apart of a birthday care package absolutely loved them she said they beat all her other socks which is a big deal as far as i know the extra cushion make her feet feel relaxed and not compressed i ll buy more for more care packages soon love then the right thickness not to thin not to thick and they stay i wear over my socks my absolute favorite sports sock for working out the elastic is to tight around the ankle the cushioning makes them heavier than i expected so i am saving them to wear in fall and winter the pair i tried were very comfortable and easy for my arthritic hands to put on i have the skinniest ankles and for whatever reason they were too snug the foot part fit fine i ordered the correct size just dont understand the ankle thing has never happened before on these skinny legs there was no size option i didn t notice that i put a pair of the socks on wearing them around the house with no shoes but by the end of the day they were full of pills fuzz balls and looked about a year old advertised as 68 cotton and they are 59 polyester and 39 cotton not soft they feel like ployester these socks run very small not even close to a womens size 9 love my socks and all hanes products quality at a descent price i ordered black hanes low cut socks size 9 11 and received size 5 9 not the size i ordered love your products the quality and of course the feel of the material love these socks soft comfortable durable holds their shape long time user i bought these socks hoping that they were a little higher than the low socks but not as high as the ankle socks these are perfect the elastic holds the socks where they re supposed to be they do not fall down into your sneakers when you walk or run the greatest part is that these are sized at 5 9 where most are 7 10 i have small feet and these are the perfect length with the cushioned footbed i am so glad that i bought 3 10 packs in white and 3 in black i hope these are going to be carried by hanes for a long time as i will purchase these again i thought the tops would have come up a little further on the ankle but overall they work on my very sensitive feet hanes socks are the only socks with a no seam type toe seams on my toes make for a very achy feet i can find that i can afford thank you these fit perfectly at first then after about 3 5 washings they shrunk now they fit but just barely kinda disappointing these socks are great easy to wear and easy to wash too i will most likely be buying more of these socks i purposely purchased these in black because white socks tend to go dull very quickly even when you use bleach no complaints so far a little thicker than most in same price range for added comfort slightly tight at top better for thin ankle person,women's clothing,0

649,Athletic Work Women's Athleisure Knit Capri Pants,7.5,4.7,343.0,comfortable and fashionable best capris ever great fit great price athletic works capris favorite capris yoga and beyond easy inexpensive everyday cotton stretch capris perfect spring and fall capris comfy soft good quality material perfect for summer disappointed great capri pants good quality and washes without shrinking glad these are still carried my favorite pants to hang out in not bad comfortable and attractive,these capri pants are great they fit well and are so comfortable they can be lounged in all day yet they look so nice they can be worn to any casual event great for a round of golf when it x80 x99s not very hot love love love i will buy more soooo soft has pockets look great comfy as house clothes but could run errands in these i ve got to order more when you find something good you want to have more i have a broken ankle with a big boot on these are great because i can stretch them over the boot they are also very comfortable to sit in all day the material is soft and comfortable to wear i like the way they fit the legs are tapered for a nice fit i ll buy more love these so i hope they don t quit making them or walmart carrying them n ntook almost two weeks to get them shipped great fit great feel perfect for spring and fall outdoor walking jogging i purchased a size s i am 5 6 130lbs these fit great and are true to size and the pictures online i especially love the pockets and that the material is not too thick or too thin i purchased several pairs of capris to wear to yoga class and i really love the fit and style of these they are comfortable and flexible enough to wear for yoga practice but i can keep them on if i need to stop somewhere and not feel like i am wearing tights to the grocery store or post office nthese have nice sized pockets and the drawstring makes them great for staying up if i drop my cell phone into the pocket i love the color not just another pair of black yoga pants but a nice neutral that i can mix and match tops with and still look cute i love these casual cotton capris for everyday around the house or to run out for an errand they are light and comfortable and you could even use them for sleepwear or exercise just an easy inexpensive piece to have in your wardrobe i suggest having a few pair around i love these i roll up the bottom and cuff just under the knee the fabric is thin so not too warm these are spring and fall capris perfect for this weather not sure how long they will hold up because fabric is thin but for the price if i get two or three years then i m happy these would be great if they came in a size xs i chanced it with the size small but they re way too baggy i m usually and xs or a 2 so they are likely true to size if i had to guess or a bit larger if anything the material is very comfotable and soft though they seemed like a good quality for the price the only reason for the 4 5 was the lack of size xs option if they had them in my size i d re order these are perfect for summer light fabric and well fitted i ordered 3 more i already have a pair of these pants in a different color so i ordered these i like that they are true to size and they are very comfortable to wear around the house although with this pair i ordered i wore them twice and they ended up with a large hole in the knee it s disappointing that for the price and with just everyday wear they didn t last any longer than two days i am a slim person and these do run small so i purchased a black pair in a medium i love the way the fit that they have front pockets and the fact that the leg is slim but not tight i washed them in cold water and hung them to dry since i do not want them to shrink i have many many pairs of these i love the way they fit and wear also have the longer pants as well these are extremely comfortable i purchased a large because i like loose fitting clothes when exercising the pockets are convenient and able to handle an iphone plus i ve purchased these before in a different color and they are very comfortable great for in the house and if you have to make a quick run to the store i don t feel i have to change very well constructed and wash nicely they are made from very soft fabric and are not hot i believe the fit is a bit loose but very comfortable i have four of these in different colors and are my favorite pants to hang out in or run errands these are very casual capri type sweatpants lightweight they are good for running errands where you know you will not run into anyone they are great for haning around the house on warmer days i like that the pants are not very short and fall about 5 inches below the knee i am 5 x80 x997 x80 x9d these would be better if they were available in brighter colors the colors available are drab and sloppy looking these are extremely comfortable and fit well the fabric is also very nice and lightweight great for warmer climates i love these pants so very comfortable launder well and reasonably priced,women's clothing,1

651,Playtex Womens 18 Hour Comfortflex Wire-Free Bra Style-4395,17.44,3.7,817.0,my favorite comfort my usual bra style nice bra good lift and keeps bust in front good experince not happy with it ugly shapeless cheap scratchy fabric wasted money playtex bra s don t buy my 2nd favorite bra good comfort and support only bra i will buy omg bullet boobs cup too large not for me avoid unless you already like this bra long time customer now disatisfied runs very small,very comfortable gives me lift and division no uni boob but still soft and comfortable had purchased one along with my usual model plus some other brands and styles a long time ago most of the other just to try ones will not buy again when i finally tried this one i was very surprised because just looking at it i didn t think it would be supportive enough 40 dd or ddd with lots of side boob but this was great so i purchased more recently and they are my new favorite i love these bras and they re not just for full figure women i m only a 34b but there s nothing that compares to a good bra and 18 hour has everything beat this is my usual style i pick i love the support and comfort but wish it gave a little more to conceal nipple exposure as it s not really the best when it comes to wearing t shirts or like material finally found a bra with support and lift sizing was a little tricky had to go up in band size and up in cup as well i wish the fabric had just a little stretch but am happy by bust is lifted and in front not under my pits i had been wearing this particular bra for 25 years and needed new with actual elastic ordering from walmart was easy steps were easy to follow and the shipment arrived on time with problems walmart had sent order confirmation shipping and delivery notices it holds the breast in place but it makes your breast looks like a cone i waited for this to come in the mail and i haven t been so disappointed in a long time right away it looked nothing like the photos no shape scratchy cheap fabric it wasn t soft at all i got a 34b and the cups were way too big and the main band was too small i m frankly mortified that anyone would wear this ugly thing not happy with this at all this is my first time ordering a bra and will not do it again the pictures give this bra a rounded smooth appearance even the pictures on the package the bra is actually made to be very pointed i will never wear this and since the the covid 19 thing is going on right now they are not accepting returns i purchased 2 so i m just out that money because these are too embarrassing to wear even a tight shirt will not help would not recommend to anyone unless the cone shape is what you are actually going for didn t fit at all cups were larger than other bra s of same size band was too tight where other bra s fit exactly right overall sent all bra s back for refund the band on this bra rolls was stated non roll band in the info provided has rough spot on back of bra that digs into my skin not pleased at all comfortable very well fitting smooth material so silk blouse hangs perfectly smooths sides and back and shapes beautifully i look great in tailored blouses as well as fitted tank tops a very comfortable basic bra well constructed for comfort and support i e daytime bra not for lower or wider necklines where it s likely to show being a large breasted woman i found this particular style brand bra perfect i have tried countless varieties and styles and i keep coming back to this one it gives very comfortable support and a very natural look bad enough the bra shapes my 42dd s into pointy bullet boobs it makes them point off into different directions seriously they are pointing off to different sides i would never ever wear this bra out in public to add insult to injury the band is so stiff and scratchy it s really driving me crazy and it s beginning to hurt in the back and i ve only been wearing it for an hour unlike the photo this bra is so high in the front i would never be able to wear it with my clothes as i do not own turtlenecks or mock turtleneck the straps are scratchy too and are digging into my shoulders did i tell you i ve only worn this for an hour now horrible bra just horrible someone ought to design and make a 42b bra that has an actual b cup not a c or d cup just because a woman is large doesn t mean she has large breasts i absolutely cannot find a bra that is comfortable because they all have cups for a larger woman first let me say there is nothing wrong with this bra it just wasn t right for me i purchased this bra on line i should have known better the bra was the right size and fit properly around but the cup wasn t quite right it pleated in the area where the font strap and the cup starts i was disappointed because boy was it comfortable alas i had to return them it s been a while since i bought bras originally i found one style i really liked years passed and i went to buy more but the number search returned a similar but different bra with the same part number years passed again and i went to buy more and the number showed no search returns this bra was one that i decided to try along with one other both now have 4 hooks for my size where as my sized use to have 3 i feel like i m wearing a corest with all this extra fabric and hooks with this bra the cup had too much material and so there were wrinkles in it that showed through my top the other bra obviously the same size did not do that my size hasn t changed since i was 13 the cup also shaped my breasts in an odd manner kind of like bullets and the points pointed outwards to the side the result wasn t at all like the photo i m now thinking i ll have to buy my bras in a brick an mortar store i m grateful for the easy returns but i m not trusting the lack of details like the hook number and the images i have ordered these bras for years ufortunately the materials and workmanship have changed the cup lining material is very stiff and scratchy against the skin the stitching around the cup was very irritating i am very disappointed in the changes that have been made and i have returned my order have had this style bra for several years and love it decided to order another one and believe you me this one ran small for me it would have taken two sizes up before i could have comfortably worn it i have discovered playtex s bras are not made as well as a few years ago for me they are smaller in size and not nearly the quality of materials are being used i bought a playtex bra a little over 2 months ago and the hook came out actually a couple weeks ago didn t think about going on this site i was wondering if there was any kind of a warranty still i do like the bra it really does make me feel younger wearing it the way it s supports

652,Women's Cotton Blend Full Length Jeggings Stretchy Skinny Pants Jeans Leggings,16.49,4.6,116.0,bought 11 pairs so far these are perfect a bit of a tight fit great fabric over all well worth the money i paid seem to be semi disposable jeggings about 3 4 mos disappointing legs super short look like capris these are a great choice yes definitely buy them you won t be disappointed awful great purchase beware horrible seller glad i bought all the colors,these are the most comfortable jeggings i have ever worn the fit is amazing other twice as expensive jeggings pinched at the seams in the waist whereas these jeggings fit seamlessly the sizing is true to size and last these jeggings have actual working front and back pockets n ndefinitely recommend these and i will be purchasing more perfect fit super comfy ordered blue also and they were capri length and i m only 5 ft this pair fit perfectly and were nice and long as the should be that s how much i love them will buy more when the colors are restocked they fit beautifully just the right amount of stretch love the pockets wash nicely warm water low heat no shrinkage these pants are great the quality is decent they are a decent weight or thickness of fabric comes in all different colors that i really like fits perfect i bought a medium and i weigh about 118 it s way too difficult to find leggings jeggings with pockets and a normal fit nowadays so i jumped at the chance i don t usually like buying clothes online because you can t try them on but i took the risk these jeggings unfortunately have a bit of a tighter fit compared to ones i ve bought in the past so maybe try buying a size up the material isn t quite the softest out there and they are a little on the thin side but if you re desperate for front pockets you can actually use these come in multiple colors and can provide that functionality for you well i personally loved these pants i m built hippy not heavy just curvy so they didn t quite work for my shape the back pockets were a little too far on the sides and gave the backside a wider appearance which is why i returned them however the fabric was amazingly soft gorgeous colors and very comfy i was disappointed to have returned them but didn t have enough longer shirts to make them flattering nif you have a thinner shape or built less curvy these will get amazing i love the texture of these not so see through like others i like how they feel when i wear them the waistline is a bit off the back seems lower than the front causing me to pull them up in the back now and then didn t have front pockets is very lightweight and doesn t protect from the cold nice and stretchy though semidisposable very comfortable but they aren t made to be machine washed even in a bag first the studs fall out then the fabric near all the seams gives way they fall apart in the wash over a fairly short time about 3 4 mos if machine washed in a bag and hung up to dry every time but as i love the fit and predictability so much i will buy them again unless the price goes up over about 12 00 14 00 when i took them out of the packaging the first thing that came to mind was that i must have made a mistake and ordered a children s size checked the order and nope they were listed as a woman s size disappointed returned bought two pairs one white one blue the white are long like they should be the blue look like capris will be returning i love these pants this is my third pair i may get them in bkack as well nicely made comfortable and they look good i love these pants i got the white ones and i love them perfect fit i thought when i first saw them that they looked small but looks can be deceiving and i m glad i tried them on they are the type of pants that you will want to wear all the time especially as a larger woman i really like comfortable clothes i did go down a size because i like a snug fit but i would have been just as fine to get my original extra large size too because they hug your body you can dress them up or down did i mention i love these lol i will be buying more love the color true to size fit and the comfortable feel i purchased this thru walmart website but you cant return these pants to walmart if they dont fit beautiful fit right in my body thanks perfect for what i need them for in the store they are priced 9 99 of course they are extended sizes i bought 2 pairs really nice and comfortable i would have bought more but all of the other good colors were sold out i m changing my review to 1 star because of the seller s attitude horrible i wanted to start an exchange 3 business days and a weekend after the expiration date for a smaller size after having already bought 6 pairs i simply wanted a different size not a refund seller refused didn t care that i had already bought numerous pairs and that i had already reordered the new jeans in the correct size absolutely no concern for the customer whatsoever uncaring bullheaded just horrible to deal with i ve never had this problem with walmart i wonder why they re even allowed to sell on the walmart website i m never buying anything from this seller again and i hope you don t either i love these pants i see that the bad reviews say that they are big in the waist and that is why i really like them i am a chubby woman well 5 1 and weight 152lbs and it hard to find pants that fit form fitting in legs and don t cut of my circulation in the waist i would say these are more in in leggings or pajama jean department which is perfect for me as it is super hot in the inland

waistband not a zipper fly to bind and cut into the waist and the denim is not super thin they are a regular denim weight fabric i can t say enough about how happy i am with this purchase they re a good fit although slightly short if you re expecting full length jeans the kangaroo pocket one connected loop of material is rediculous two separate pockets please i liked them well enough to buy a second pair and stitched a seam to separate the pockets they are very comfortable but they have wide legs i have an apple figure and they aren t flattering me due to the width of the pants legs but if you re a pear they d probably be perfect and flattering these run much smaller than the same size i bought last year these are cut different and stiff i bought these my mail and washed them before i tried them on so i can t return them even if you order up a size the fabric is uncomfortable the fit was not what i expected i ordered online because you still can t try clothes on in the store if i had been able to try these on in the store i wouldn t have bought that size i didnt like the fact that the front pocket didnt separate put hand on the right side pocket and it goes straight across to the left they are made smaller than the pull on jeans from last year probably to the fact the old one is made in indonesia and the current jean is made in bangladesh nthe thing i did like was the color of the jean and the length was great these pants are so comfortable that they are the only long pants that i wear for work and everyday ntoo bad i did not know about this company twenty years ago a very nice lightweight denim jean being a petite size 5 2 the fit was perfect at waist and length very comfortable to wear nice pockets too would definately purchase again the only issue i have found with these are that they are a little short just enough that they have to be rolled up nice weight color and fit like the wide band would prefer they were tighter in the legs but overall i m satisfied jeans are too low cut and constantly roll down and are uncomfortable they are also too short and i m 5 5 these pants are very comfortable the waist is snug without binding they didn t shrink after washing fast delivery easy ordering they are a great product fit is good last super long i only wear this brand great price terrible fit legs are huge a good fit which is not easy to do with jeans they look nice too and are comfortable great fit and so comfortable,women's clothing,0

soft and comfy warm soft pj pants to short finally so comfortable amazingly soft size up as its small for size soft and comfy but fuzz comes off when washed better than expected happy customer,i love these pj pants they are incredibly soft and comfortable the fabric is that dreamy cloud like material that many throws are made from i wanted something like that but many are too thick to wear year round these are perfect really a steal at the price point these are the most comfortable pants i ve ever had i d stay in them all day if i could bought some for my daughters and they love them too make sure you follow the care instructions my one daughter dried hers on high and now they aren t as soft i am starting to get in these earlier and earlier so comfortable and the waistband is not binding ni bought four of these and i i sized up so i wouldn t feel too constricted and i am glad i did because due to a surgical site i don t like feeling that way but if not for that i would be fine in my usual size nget em while you can love these bottoms right in time for winter and the cold air conditioning love how they fit they wash up really well i didn t put in the dryer hung to dry just smooth out no wrinkles even the ribbon it stayed in but i did put a little knot on both sides just in case the ribbon tie came out nice and roomy i m short had to just turn the top over once so i don t drag them and it worked with the ribbon tie it holds them up i ordered several of the pj pants to wear during zoom and facetime conference visits and plan to wear a long sleeve t shirt and vest to look professional this winter while being comfortable behind my desk this winter at this price it s cheaper than wearing jeans or pajamas i bought a size medium as small size was tight in groins this is super warm and is very helpful in fall and winters i did wash and dry it on high heat but the medium didn t shrink much ni did buy 5 prints for myself just to stay warm for the whole week nreference i am size 6 in pants dresses weight 133lbs normally buy size small in walmart i bought this pajama pants because i love the pattern of it makes me feel homey and cozy when it arrived i thought it would be too thick to wear around the house the material is thick fluffy flannel i feel like wearing a blanket for pants but in fact in colder months it helps me gets warm and cozy and i never feel cold it is the right amount of thickness i wish i bought another color very soft comfortable and warm these pajama pants are perfect for the colder seasons i m 5 9 and usually wear a size 6 i purchased these in an m one thing i do not like is that they are a little short but this definitely is not a dealbreaker very soft so comfortable and warm these pajama pants are perfect for the colder seasons i m 5 8 and usually wear a size 6 i purchased these in a m and they fit well one thing i do not like is they are a little short but this is definitely not a dealbreaker i have bought probably 30 pieces of secret treasures past years from slippers to tank tops i have a few pairs of their minky pants which i adore however lately their quality is terrible tank tops are thick plastic iron on and their pants sized way off and the fabric is similar to those cheap blankets with arm holes nothing like past years so very disappointing i don t like to wear anything with legs to sleep these are so soft and warm i wear them around the house in the evening until bed time i love them i think i already reviewed these have purchased 3 pair love the soft warm comfort of these pants will wear all winter to keep warm around the house i recommend these as lounge pants or if your house is very cold at night they will be too warm for me to wear for sleeping i ordered this and there way to short they wont let you return anything now days you also cant try the clothes on walmart is making people waste money there gonna lose customers because of this finally found pjs to fit my daughter how ever to long i fear thats just our fate as shot women to deal with nothing fitting correctly everywhere waist length sad but true these are the most comfortable pair of pajama bottoms i have ever owned i am definitely buying more most comfortable pajamas ever so soft but not to heavy perfect fit on me as the pant legs dont drag on the ground great for shorter people just love them wish there were more colors designs to choose from so i can get more good print soft material too tight for small size i am 133 lb and small size was terribly tight on thigh and crotch area so i bought medium and that fits well also will be ok if medium shrinks a bit love these so soft and comfy husband however not so much when washed gets fuzz all over the other clothes told him next time they are washed i will turn them inside out and see if that helps love them so so so soft my granddaughter what s a pair so i ordered her a small adult size i m hoping they fit her she is only 10 years old but is tall for her age these are great price quality and comfort i like them so much i m ordering two more pairs today,women's clothing,1

time,these are very comfortable i love the d lite styles couldn t decide on 1 pair soo i bought many so now i had to build a bigger house with a bigger closet i wear a size 7 and 1 2 and need it to be wide i was very surprised that they actually made this shoe in the wide i received it quickly and it fit perfectly and so comfortable it is a normal size fit i would say to anyone shopping beautiful sneakers i absolutely love them well for starters i ve never owned a pair of sketchers so i was a little hesitant i juggle two jobs so i definitely needed better work shoes since i m on my feet majority of the time and my ankle usually flares up after being on my feet for too long the memory foam technology is just brilliant i love the comfortability and the support i receive from these my ankle hasn t flared up and i m totally inlove with these i wear my shoes just about anywhere i go especially when i am going to be walking a lot they are sooo comfortable the memory foam is amazing i absolutely love sketchers they don t wear out as fast like most shoes i definitely get my out of them i really love my new sneakers i put off buying sneakers due to my extra wide feet and never finding women s sneakers to fit my size in the store i was afraid to order shoes on line but i was overly surprised by how well these sneakers fit and feel these are the only shoes i wear i have tried other major brands and none of them can compare i m on my feet for 10 hours a day and the support is awesome i need the extra cushion and support because i have had 2 back surgeries after a long day at work my feet don t hurt and my back doesn t hurt as bad with these shoes i won t wear any other brands of shoes than skechers even my sandals are skechers i own 14 pairs of skechers and the d lites are my favorite sneaker they always look good and they have so many different designs anyone could find a pair that fits them i generally get a pair a year and it s not from them falling apart but because i can no longer get them clean looking i wear them everywhere even on my ranch i have turned so many people on to skechers and now they are their favorite shoe also la parte de adelante se descoloriza muy r pido y se vuelve blanca this is my first pair of trainers i ve got 2 pairs of bob s and absolutely love those so i thought i would try these i am so glad i did they are comfortable and don t hurt my feet i ve got issues with a broken toe that didn t heal correctly i have to have more room on my left foot to fit the bump on top of my big toe which makes it hard to find shoes to fit my right foot most of the time they are too big and i slip out since i ve had to buy a size bigger to fit my broken left toe mishap but these shoes fit my correct size they fit both my feet with no troubles and they don t hurt my feet or toes i absolutely am in love and am now a forever skechers woman the shoes are very comfortable the memory foam isn t the greatest but i do have great insoles i do like the fact that when you say wide width you mean it that was a great deal i really do love these shoes i work in house keeping and have to move fast they have been working great form me i will definitely reorder when the current pair wear out thank you i use the shoe s for working in a warehouse lot s of walking pushing pulling carrying box s up and down stair s constantly and my shoe s feel great all night long i carefully researched before buying these shoes i am a bigger woman who has had ankle surgery and have pins in my ankle i find myself twisting my ankle often as it is very weak so i searched for a pair of comfortable stylish sneakers and found these read lots of reviews that said to order a half size up so i did and now i m stuck with shoes that are too big aside from that they re the most comfortable shoes i ve ever worn lots of cushion and feel kind of springy they break in easily are very breathable and overall comfortable i ordered wide width and was pleased with the width the shoes are stylish and trendy so far i wear them daily from working out to running errands and such i will definitely order another pair as for other plus size women searching for comfortable stylish sneakers order these and you wont be dissatisfied if you want comfortable shoes these are for you i only wear sketchers shoes because i have to wear wide width shoes and i can always count on them fitting perfectly they are very true to size and width i have them in many different colors they are comfortable enough to wear all day and night i love them they re perfect quality is poor the sneakers look great but wearing them is another story very harsh on the feet thus uncomfortable cannot wear them for more than a couple of hours i don t recommend these shoes at all one of the best pair of shoes i have ever owned so comfortable like walking on air easy on the feet and back so thankful i bought them n i m four foot nine and these sneakers give me height without the added weight of a heavy soled shoe love them they are delightful just like the name states i was shocked that they had the memory insole as well that was a plus i recommend these shoes if you have small feet and can t find shoes in your size i wear a size 5 and 6 seems to be the going shoe size these days make certain of your size the go one or one and a half size up b c these shoes are terribly tight i wasted good money on what i thought was my size but had them on for a small while and they hurt my feet at least i know a place i can donate them so not a complete waste of money these shoes are super comfortable i feel 3x in 1 year and fractured my fibula each time on both feet my right foot never healed properly i still suffer from pain every so often having comfortable shoes is really important for me these skechers d lites sneakers are like pillows for my feet the memory foam makes them so soft on your feet they are so comfortable it s i like i m not wearing athletic shoes and more like slippers they are the only shoes i can wear all day and my feet don t hurt or feel tired after if your looking for a comfortable pair of shoes these are shoes i highly recommend them i just wanted to say thank you i love my shoes,women's clothing,0
660,Just My Size Women's Plus Size French Terry Pocket Capri,11.96,4.4,773.0,a new favorite comfortable overly roomy legs but definitely worthwhile sharing my thoughts very heavy thick fabric soft material snug 5x capris not happy with the style beware runs very small beware runs very small bad waistband great capris at a great sale price comfortable happy nice love these style and comfort i was melting comfortable nice comfy,i am living in these pants they are very comfy and a good choice when you want to be a bit cooler than wearing sweatpants they wash well and are flattering to my hourglass figure light weight and comfortable nice for at home or running errands i bought two colors very satisfied good fit not too big at the bottom of the legs these are almost exactly what i wanted i would have given them 4 5 stars but that wasn t an option the waist fits perfectly likewise the length is exactly what i wanted the only problem is the width of the legs i wanted them to be a little roomy but they are very roomy i m oddly shaped apparently and don t quite fit into regular sizes but plus are usually too big my hip thigh waist ratio is just not the same as a lot of curvy women i e i don t have that super sexy pear shape which is the shape these are made for so i expected that the hips and thighs might be baggy on me just not quite as much as they are i get an unflattering more rotund princess jasmin effect with these n nall that being said i got these for lounging and exercise also i tend to wear large long shirts untucked so these will be perfect for me i was hoping i d be able to wear them out too but i don t think they are quite suited for that given how they fit me hence the 4 stars n noverall i highly recommend these and am definitely a new fan of french terry fabric same fit as the last ones i purchased a couple of years ago fabric is not 100 cotton and the fabric is thinner great for summer ware fit is good well made nice i just was surprised at the heaviness of the material i live in florida and can t imagine that these wintry shorts will be comfy very comfortable material but pockets should be reinforced everything in my pockets would sag down causing it to look odd i bought the 5x and they fit like a 4x they are super snug which is uncomfortable the string on the pants leg is already coming off after only having them for one day i like the material and fit but i hate the wide waist band being short waisted it pokes under my rib cage which is very uncomfortable runs very small i ordered my normal size of 1x and i couldn t possibly wear them going to return whenever walmart allows returns again very disappointed runs very small i ordered my normal size of 1x and i couldn t possibly wear them going to return whenever walmart allows returns again very disappointed i like the pockets but what i don t like is the waistband if only they would stitch the elastic to the waistband so that the elastic would not roll up or twist inside the band that really wouldn t take that much more time of labor i am very pleased with these lightweight fleece capris they will be great for summer they hit at my natural waistline have a drawstring and deep pockets i am washing them in cold water and line drying to avoid shrinkage i bought a size smaller than i usually do so they are a little tight but still comfortable they do stretch out as you wear them through the day i think the next size larger would be too big i like the drawstring waist happy nice price nice quality nice pockets i am somewhat pear shaped with small waist and these fit great in plus roomy without being too relaxed fyi not the same look or weave as the terry jogger love these comfortable pockets perfect size looks great buy in every color runs small waste band is very thick very comfortable sizing perfect will purchase again they are thick more in the area they could be worn in winter i was roasting in them make them little lighter for summer guys good quality but too long super comfy holds up nicely after several wash and dry cycles,women's clothing,0

666,Athletic Work's Women's Plus Size Dri-More Core Zip-Up Hoodie,12.0,4.1,267.0,great light comfortable overall a nice jacket that looks good very cute hoodie hard to find a navy jacket works for me large shoulders beware did not fit me properly no cuffs on sleeves bad description of product and undersized to bad best jacket in the world hoodie x large hoodie comfortable jacket and matches pants way too small nice hoodie sigh great quality hoodie miss marked bag to short,i live in these lightweight jacket layer in winter love the hood just a comfortable jacket with pockets for a coverup in over air conditioned grocery stores to chilly morning early walks you wont be disappointed i have them in all the colors and have been buying a new one every year for another year of use must have at least a dozen over the years you wont be disappointed it s everything i was expecting and more super duper soft the hood has extra room for my bun or if i just need to hide my face i don t have to tug or tussle it s perfect wish they had more colors for women like me these are the best jackets for just a cover up i have ordered danskin for years and it is a great product i have one of these in the navy keeps its shape over years of wear fits just like it looks on the model if you buy your usual size that was my experience anyway i m not a big fan of hoodies but i ll put up with it because it s nicely fitted reviews said it runs small so i ordered 4x where a nice black jacket from walmart works in 3x dont order too large had to get the 3x which is ok but still a bit big nice lightweight jacket bottom is not elastacized and fits boxy ok but rides up and a bit wonky not as nice as the black style i have which fits more snugly ok as it is hard to find navy this summer it seems it has to be sent to an address thus shipping twice why not to a store i normally wear 18 20 so order accordingly came nice and fast at normal postage rate less than a week this is a fantastically soft hooded sweatshirt light and the color is very nice the sleeves are longer than normal but by just a few inches the shoulders and upper arms are snug i ordered a size up from my normal 2x as per other reviews the waist is not bloused it is a straight cut from under the arms to the hem the hem is thick and flat no elastic the cut is boxy if you are busty it will be snug if your upper arms are thick it will be snug it s not made for curves as the cut all around is straight however there is a lot of stretch it is not really a going out hoodies more of a lounger or for fitness the thickness is about double what a t shirt would be and the the zipper is barely a bother i love this even though it is not the least bit flattering on me so i wear it around the house when i want to be comfy but not too warm or bundled up it will show back rolls if you have them and bra marks it is that thin you can t beat the value of this product but unfortunately i had to return it because the arms were tighter than i like the arms are the reason i get a 2x plus and this item didn t work out for me if i get a bigger size then it s too big all around i can t win but that s me if your arms are not an issue then you are getting a great jacket at a great price this would be a great light weight jacket if it had normal jacket sleeves unfortunately the sleeves don t have cuffs on them and i prefer my jackets with the cuffs way way way under sized i bought a 3xl because i wanted something extremely over sized and what i received might be the size of a xl seriously disappointed it also is poorly made and not a sweatshirt it is made of thicker shirt material definitely not what i expected to be getting yes i know this a plus size but who ever designs never take in account the proportions of a plus size body you have to think that the plus size requires ample back bust stomach area and of course the arms this product will be returned to the store my favorite jacket have had similar brands before of this exact jacket lasts for years perfect to layer in winter and has a hood to wearing by itself on cool summer days great length has pockets and washes without any problems i have it in all the colors and wear them all buy one and you ll be back for more stock up while they have them in your size you won t be disappointed love these hoodies i have 2 colors they go nicely with the yoga pants as nice loungewear that i can run to nstore in it was same size as one i am wearing but i would have had to gain 50 lbs for it to stay up on my shoulders the material in this jacket is lightweight but keeps you warm and protects you from the wind i have the danskin pants that match and it makes a nice looking comfortable set i have washed this and it is just like new ordered a 1x whick i thought would fit loose it fit like a woman s medium tight arms and couldn t even zip it closed i usually buy 1x because i am large on top a 3x probably would have fit perfect i weigh 165 bummed sent it back i purchased several colors of the danskin styles as i have been a fan of their clothing the only thing i did not like about the hoodie is its lack of length the should ve made it a couple inches longer otherwise nice hoodie this hoodie was absolutely not what i expected the fabric it was made of was way too thin compared to how it looked on line and what i expected also i got it in a size larger than my normal size and it was still tight thus the sigh beautiful smooth and comfortable stretch cotton fabric strong high grade zipper amazing price for upscale look and quality highly recommend the packaging plastic bag is marked 2x but when i took out the top it is marked 4x the size is a 4x and the plastic bag size needs changed to 4x size description nice but skinny sleeves and not long enough,women's clothing,0
667,Hanes Women's Modal Triblend Short Sleeve Scoopneck Tee,7.0,4.1,202.0,wider than shown neck soft comfortable and pretty winner winner high quality super soft figure flattering nice basic shirt but not worth the price good fit poor fabric and construction sizing is way off poor quality tee shirt super soft modal tee shirts great basic tee size for large sizes are not accurate color is nothing like picture not what was pictured this has a little flare winner for elevated tee comfort hanes women s modal triblend short sleeve tee hanes women s modal triblend short sleeve tee,the shirt is exactly what i wanted nthe neck is more open than in the picture this is what another review said which is what led me to choose this shirt i am a merchandiser and need shirts that are comfortable move with me and don t reveal my ladies parts when i bend over this t fits the bill perfectly the fabric is soft and hangs well the neck is wide enough to be comfortable yet not so wide as to reveal bra straps i normally go up to a plus size t shirt usually 2x bc i don t like for them to be stretched too tight across the boobers i liked the shirt on the website so i thought i d try the 3x it fit great not too tight and not too short i liked the neckline it s a scoopneck as described high quality super soft stylish figure flattering top i am 5ft 4in 38d 138lbs the small is almost too tight and the medium is perfect a bit loose still get the figure flattering fit but if it was any larger it would be baggy it is small in the neck chest shoulders and looser in the middle i love the scoopneck its so much more flattering than the high crew neck or v neck styles its hard to find a scoop neck that isnt too wide this scoop neck is perfect i ordered this in a medium in nearly every color the heathered colors have almost a sweater like higher end look that can easily be dressed up but will not pill after washing this is a light breezy t shirt fits well pretty true to size maybe a little on the smaller side but i tried an xs and s and they both fit pretty well 110 lbs just depends on how loose you want it to be it s rather thin material which is great for hot weather but i didn t feel it was worth the price i paid i bought these t shirts in a bunch of colors after losing weight and needing new clothes but still working from home so i didn t need anything expensive they are ok i like the fit and the neckline the sleeves are a little short for my post weight loss batwing arms but not too bad the fabric is crap they are pilling badly after wearing and washing only a few times i also frequently find loose threads on them after washing and the hem has unraveled on a couple of them true to size maybe runs a little big i wear a l xl and got the large in these and they fit perfectly i would have given them just one or two stars if they were more expensive for the price i guess the low quality is acceptable but these are basically disposable and will not last i d rather pay a bit more for something higher quality its a nice shirt but the sizing is way off ordered a 3x to wear it as a sleep shirt but its barely the size large this tee shirt is very thin and see through the hems have come unstitched and holes have developed in various places i am using them to sleep in since they are not presentable to wear otherwise color is nothing like the picture it s much darker color nothing like picture i bought this tee in the aqua blue and green in a medium and large super comfortable and has stretch so both fit well i would just say order up one size if you want a more relaxed fit the pricing was great in my opinion as well good thickness washes well and didn t shrink nice length sleeve and the scoop neck is flattering not too low but feminine excellent value for the price bought more colors all my blouses are xxl this xxl was so tight i know sizes can differ slightly but this sizing was even near i bought a 3x to use for gardening skin tight i like the feel of the material but the color isn t even close to this picture most of them are so long they are like a mini dress on me we wash a few to see if they will shrink a little if not they will be going back the fabric is ok for a tee shirt i will say though the picture shown is quite deceiving the neck is substantially lower and wider than pictured i was disappointed i was looking for what was pictured not what was received need to update your picture i ordered 3 different hanes t s for the color and to see which fit best and this was the winner the scoop is subtle and not too low and its not a box there are some curves where they need to be n nseemed to fit true to size 2x the 3x crew had room for me and an elementary school child nice lightweight summer t shirt although i hope the fabric holds up it has some good colors would like to see hanes make a short sleeve t shirt that has a longer length sleeve for those of us who want to cover our upper arms i like shorts sleeves that go to just above the elbow and arm crease i like the shirt very comfortable to wear i did order 1 size larger than normal could have worn the size i normally wear but i like the extra room great quality and great color i bought them as sleeping shirts to go with sleeping pants that i ordered from another retailer i love these tees the colors are bright and beautiful the price is great i bought them to wear with sleep pants,women's clothing,0
668,Playtex Womens 18 Hour Cooling Comfort Wire-Free Sports Bra Style-4159,17.44,4.6,1622.0,my chest feels nice only thing missing is padded straps great bra the most comfortable bra quality bra very comfortable new design don t like it poor quality my kind of bra so disappointed love the 4150 playtex active wirefree bra 4159 active 18 hr bra comfortable great bra choice for us big gals nice bra comfortable bra honest review cups run big,i have big breast and i m not ashamed to say i needed a bra like this it is no wire and fit s as intended great smoothing effect and even brings everything in nice and neat this style is my favorite i have 3 of them fit is great fabric is substantial washing in hot water doesn t faze it i would like this same bra but with padded straps of course you can see that they don t have padded straps before you buy so i wasn t disappointed when this one arrived i love being able to order on line but return to my local store if there is a problem at first the design looked a little constricted but once i put it on it felt great it provides support in all aspect and produces a better look with any garment piece i keep trying different styles and this is the only bra that works well for me 36c comfortable attractive good price they only had 3 in stock at the time so i bought them all i already returned the other bras i bought with them i ve been buying this brand and specific style for years it is so comfortable i have sloping shoulders and the wide shoulder strap never slips down i also have a scar from surgery under one breast years ago and the wide bottom band does not irritate my scar at all it helps to not have an underwire due to my scar but the bra is still very supportive i hope they never quit making these i don t get this quality of bra where i live its great i really needed this item i had never worn an 18 hour bra before but my mom always did so i decided to try them i have to say that this bra is so very comfortable i can wear it all day long even take a nap in it and move freely without fear of being poked or falling out of the cups i do wish the straps were a little longer to allow for more adjustment but i am still glad i purchased i have been wearing this bra style for 15 years it fits me well if the straps didn t roll and slide around i d have given it a 5 star but it s frustrating to constantly be unrolling or pulling the strap back up i have to buy other products to keep the straps where they should be it s thinner than i like so has more show through i couldn t tell that from the picture i was hoping it had at least some kind of lining the seam of the part that s supposed to support you is so firmly imbedded in my skin that even when i take it off it stays that way a long time i m always aware of it being there while wearing it because the weight of me is resting on that seam i m 38dd i have bought this bra before and never had an issue these new ones where a poor fit and the back hinges where very stiff and scratched felt like plastic was used for support i sent them back this has a similar fit wearing comfort as playtex style 4159 which has been my go to bra for years i especially like the grey color the underarm panels good casual bra for 38dd bust good support the entire bra is doubled material except the nipples like amazingly comfortable and structured and then super thin and nipples feeling like theyre hanging out all by themselves i have been wearing these bras the 4159 playtex active breathable comfort wirefree bra for several years now i will hunt them out if need be because they are so very comfortable and the fit is exactly right for me please continue to stock this wonderful bra so much better than so many others so comfortable and no rough edges like some of the other 18 hour ones i love this bra it s the most comfortable i have found it s not easy to find a wireless b cup when the sizes go over 38 but there are several playtex styles with a decent selection of colors i have had the worst luck finding a comfortable all day bra in my size so far this one fits the bill it doesn t bind or chafe and i can forget about having it on all day would like more color choices though maybe pink or blue or maybe even red this bra purchased for my mother who is handicapped she needed one that is comfortable and non chafing while still providing reasonably good support my mom is a double d even though she is elderly she still cares about good support this one fits the bill the material breathes enough that it does not irritate her skin i found this bra was overpriced at some places would not have given it a good value high rating but reasonably priced at walmart com this is a good comfortable bra i do like to have several without seams that could show under clothes the material is soft i do have trouble with one strap falling down on one shoulder as i have with many bras for whatever reason i wish this bra and many others these days could be adjusted from the front so you don t have to remove it to adjust it and would be more room for adjustment as the strap that falls has to be adjusted more than the other bra is more comfortable than more expensive bras i have bought in the past however the pictures are deceiving when the bra arrived my husband remarked that it looked like a bra from the 80 s and it was a grandma bra the bra has no padding whatsoever so everything is visible it s also a little snug on the band i m currently searching for another playtex bra this is my second purchase and this one is better than the first the bra runs a little big in the cups i ordered a size smaller and it fits better the quality of the first bras i ordered was poor one of the seams fell apart after wearing it once the lower shelf works best to lift when the bra is snug,women's clothing,0

670,"Fruit of the Loom Women's Microfiber Brief Panties, 6 Pack",8.5,4.1,242.0,comfortable best buy in years for underwear great value so comfortable good buy previously open packages somethings changed idk different weaving bad ok most comfortable and quality underwear stay cool and comfortable in these very uncomfortable very comfortable just what i was looking for my favorites,i purchase this item over walmart website the underwear did not come in the colors as shown above i was a little disappointed i received black and beige underwear in the package that shows the color above i kept the underwear because of the craftsmanship excellent pair underwear i thought i was purchasing the color that is shown above otherwise i m well pleased with fruit of the loom women s microfiber underwear i ve been struggling to find comfortable briefs with a narrow waistband i m usually not a fan of microfiber i used to prefer cotton but these really are comfortable and fit well this is the first pair of underwear i have bought in years that does not roll down it is very comfortable and breaths the price is also very good great to find underwear that is true to size and the leg openings are not huge if you wear a larger size i was a bit worried about the elastic on the legs giving me a problem but that has not happened i also was worried about the material remaining damp but it does not i have worn cotton for many years but these are more comfortable and no binding anywhere i give a total thumbs up my panties are the only thing out of 6 purchases that are true to size and i like them be careful who you ordered from did not realize that clothes are sent from many different places i am unable to get out and go shopping but this is not an option for me either very sad second order of these they are a great value for the money they hold up very well thru the laundry no shrinking nor elastic stretching these are the most comfortable panties i have ever tried they feel so light and smooth almost like they aren t there they wear so good under clothing no seam lines and are breathable good solid colors that don t run or fade after washing i abosolutely recommend these the material is very soft size 10 thou i could of used a smaller size their very stretchy very sheer alittle support good enough for those monthly issues lol nno muffin top n n i used a folding chair in picture i recieved the package and four of the five boxes of underwear were torn open two with underwear untapped and unrolled and folder and placed back in the box no where does the discripition say previously open packages th product itself is ok as far as quality the delivery is horrible very disappointed now i first bought this pack of microfiber briefs 2 years ago they were soft and comfy no ride up and great quality now what happened the pack of six were different sizes the fabric was not as soft and the waistband was coming un stitched from the fabric same of polyester spandex then previously out of the 6 pairs that i ordered i can only wear2 pair comfortably they are all suppose to be size 7 but only 2 pair are comfortable the other 4 are to tight now does that happen when they all come out of the same package i have purchased these previously in this package every pair are smaller than those i already have since i washed them before wearing can i return them i absolutely love these underwear i typically like to buy nylon underwear but this is better it is kind of a mix between cotton and nylon and is very soft and conforms to your body it is very flexible and doesn t ride up anywhere it stays put it doesn t have fancy lace or anything to show through if you are wearing leggings or something that is more form fitting i definitely am going to stock up on these wow ive finally made the switch from white cotton panties to these i don t hardly even sweat in these unlike my cotton ones that were rarely ever dry in the summer months plus with no sweat theres no odor and no heat rash pain from staying damp love them they are the right size and they fit nice and comfortable nice and silky very nice i advise other customers to get them if i could give this 0 stars i would these underwear are so uncomfortable these are a waste of money don t buy these trust me first pair of undies i have ever had that were both comfortable and fit well love the soft fabric i absolutely love the panties i have ordered at least four times on line and they are all what the description claims ni highly recommend these panties to other shoppers what can i say i loved the colors the fit and that they are good quality yet not over priced although if youre looking sexy these are not but if you re looking for comfort wedgie free and good quality now these are it i love these panties although they don t always last a long time as they seem to fray easily but are still my go to panties i did cancel this order when i found a new package i had forgotten i had but will order more when needed,women's clothing,0

682,Women's Plus Size V Neck Floral Tops Short Sleeve Summer Loose T-shirts,12.96,1.6,453.0,ny mom china made not good quality total misrepresentation do not buy it s awful never ever again will i waste the money cheap and uncomfortable material very sad unhappy don t bother disappointed terrible fabric unwearable not true to size disappointing returned,took a long time to be delivered from china by way of ca i did not recognize it not at all as pictured looks like a silk smock don t waste your time or money so not worth it material is terrible and when it comes in the mail you have absolutey no idea where its from as it comes weeks after everything else you order with no name or anything do not recommend when the items arrived i was so disappointed it did not look like the picture it was like one of those old lady granny type shirt and material and it was two tremendously small like a person what a small built may be able to wear it i almost gave it to my neighbor who s an elderly woman she house dresses and this looks like a miniature house dress because she s tiny that s how disappointed i was these blouses are evidently made in china they are not even close to right size and yes i used sizing chart to be sure i ordered 1x and evidently should have ordered a 4x at minimum nnow for quality very flimsy not well stitched and hem line is uneven complete rip off this material is more suitable for a light trade show bag than a piece of clothing not breathable or what you would expect with a normal polyester material this would stick to your skin on a hot humid day cant return because i ripped it trying to take if off arms way to tight and this material does not give don t waste your money on this yeah i m mad i wasted my money on this purchase i dont normally write a harsh review but i feel everything about this item picture material sizing is a misrepresentation do not buy it s awful xa0i gave it a star just to write a review i was so disappointed this shirt is made of very poor quality material it is stiff it is not flowy as the picture portrays if has thread coming out all over and it is way too small i gave it to my daughter in law that wears a size 12 and it was tight across her breast xa0 i gave it to my granddaughter as a play shirt for her dolls i have never bought anything from walmart with such poor quality all the way around i also bought another shirt online the same day and had the same problems if this is walmart s new quality of clothes online i won t be shopping online with walmart anymore i am just floored that walmart would even sell this low quality shirt xa0walmart would be going out of business with out me buying from them but i won t be buying junk from them either would give 0 stars if i could poorly made in no way is the shirt i have the one in that picture i ve cried for hours about this the material of this shirt is like wearing inexpensive bed sheets there is no give when you move but a whole lot of noise when the fabric rubs against itself nit took longer to get here than stated i didn t listen to the bad reviews i hope the nex person does very poor quality and fabric and not true to fit body is very baggy and arm sleeves are very tight fabric doesn t give would definitely not recommend this it was so cute on the manniquen but fabric nothing like it showed too small and yes i order the next size up from what i usually wear sad i had ordered it for a particular occasion i got excited because it came it earlier than expected but now early enough to order something else love the tops and bought 3 but fits well i wear a 22 24 for breast room these tops had to be a 5x and the arms are so tight i alsmost want to cut them off annoying the shirt is nothing like it looks in the picture the size is completely off the material is cheap and not comfortable at all beware this product is not actually coming from walmart this is awful the material is horrible it is not soft and drapey like the photo and it runs extremely small cut small possibly 2 sizes material is nothing like what you see in the picture more stiff but flimsy and very shiny garbage extremely thin material fits really weird around the shoulders not at all what was expected this shirt is terrible the fabric is something i have never felt before there was no easy return i just threw it away do not waste your money if they made it out of actual fabric that you could wear the style is cute bu t it reminds me of umbrella fabric or something i ordered a 5xl 30 32 and it fits like a 1xl 18 20 poorly made and looked nothing like the shirt on the ad i only gave it 1 star because i had too in order to comment well and at least it was the same color will be returning and shopping at trusted stores only from now on i had been eyeing this shirt for quite a while and finally regrettably ordered the material is very thin and the fit is horrible tight in the arms and shoulders very cheap material if you order go two sizes bigger as i am normally a large or x large and the x large was tight and short very disappointed it looks so pretty in the picture definitely would not recommend this shirt took forever to ship and was so small i am plus sized i usually buy a 1x 2x i bought this in a 3x and i guarantee it was the size of a lg xl then i take it back to walmart and they can t give me a refund i m sure that was in the small print i recall making a conscious decision to order from an outside seller i won t do so again n nproduct arrived with no invoice no return instructions absolutely nothing beware to keep the package as you need it to return walmart shipped the return for me but i m still disappointed they could not provide a refund since this purchase was part of my walmart order the service desk told me you can change your search settings so nothing shows that isn t from walmart the material was cheap this came from an overseas factory as noted by a cheap small size sticker with only a 3x stamped on it walmarts quality has always been very good until now very disappointed will be donated vs worn its like walmart quality is becoming roses quality sad to see this happening,women's clothing,0

these levi strauss jeans a great fit for all shapes and sizes this review was collected as part of a promotion i like that levi s brand is always high quality jeans that fit right these jeans fit good they don t stretch at mid rise but aren t stiff like other brands when you first get they are comfortable for all day wear the pants stretch at the hip and thighs i like that they are dark jeans goes well with any color shirt the bottom of the pants open up wider than leg area i like this in the jeans because i live on a farm and wear boots i like i can have the jeans out side of my boots at bottom this review was collected as part of a promotion i m only giving these jeans 4 stars out of five because of the legs being more a skinny leg style i adore the style and color but unfortunately the legs are smug around the calves and rather large in the waistband i carry most of my excess weight in my waist so i was surprised to see how baggy these around levi is a brand i trust not only for quality but also for sizing as a plus size woman it can be hard to find a great fit well my search ended here with these jean s they feel so comfortable and pair well with just about everything i can dress it up with a nice blouse or tone it down with a tank or tee and flats either way levi s has struck gold with these pants overall i love the quality of these jeans and know i will get a lot of use out of them this review was collected as part of a promotion the jeans are a perfect fit the jeans weren t too big or too small i was able to move around and squat without any issues the jeans are

modern straight jeans try them out and watch the smile on your face glow this review was collected as part of a promotion i recently had the chance to try levis jeans but i was initially concerned about them being the correct fit due to my recent weight gain i tried them on and they fit like a glove the first thing i love about them is the wash the wash is a beautiful medium dark blue not too light or too dark the sticking is impeccable and it has just enough stretch to hug your curves beautifully the jeans are soft and so comfortable the length is great being that i am only 5 3 i plan on having these jeans for many years to come this review was collected as part of a promotion i love the levi s brand it s always high quality jeans that fit right these jeans fit perfectly they have stretch which is good they aren t stiff like other brands i like that they are dark jeans goes well with any color just didn t like that the bottom is too wide other than that i m pleased this review was collected as part of a promotion i got these to try cause i was looking for some nice fall jean s i will say when i first got them i thought there going to be these uncomfortable jeans they are the complete opposite i put them on and the way they stretched was so perfected there not them stretchy at top uncomfortable everywhere else they are completely stretchy when i bent down they stretched with me they weren t tight on my stomach or anything these are now my favorite jean s to wear this review was collected as part of a promotion these new signature by levi stretchy jean s fit real nice they give me curves where i need them they are kinda high waisted so it help hide my roll i love that they stretch they look good from the front and back this review was collected as part of a promotion fit in the waste and the short length was perfect i m 5 5 200lb and curvaceous but the fabric is very stretchy felt like the pants are constantly sliding down i have very large calves and they are very tight tried to go up to the next size but still the same issue had to return both sizes fit in the waste and the short length was perfect i m 5 5 200lb and curvaceous but the fabric is very stretchy felt like the pants are constantly sliding down i have very large calves and they are very tight tried to go up to the next size but still the same issue had to return both sizes i like these except for the fact the pockets are very short and not deep enough to hold stuff and also wish they had more blue ones instock than just the two that s listed but glad i got them in time since now it seems there running low on my size i m only 5 4 but i like extra length on my jeans so i ordered an 18l they are perfect to wear with heels or booties love love love them the fit is amazing they make my butt look fantastic and very comfortable the thighs too tight they are too long the materials are too thin not for big thigh shorter people the pants need a shorter extra sgort option those need hicker cloth best tall plus size jean i ve worn in years i m 6 ft and the length is perfect they fit in all the right places not too skinny in the leg to make you look out of proportion but tight enough to not look like a mom jean thanks levi s for these great jeans and the great price i really love these jeans and am a really big fan of levis as a brand there s no gapping in my waist baggy crotch area or excessive tightness in the calf area these slid right on and comfortable enough to wear all day these fit perfectly since the pandemic i ve gained weight so i needed a larger size in jeans these jeans slid on beautifully and fit me well all over i actually came back to get a few more pairs and thought i d leave a review i m a tall plus size female and it s hard to find jeans that fit me right but after i order these jeans i was shocked and amazed how the feel and fit on me dislike the short front pockets everything else was great love the way they fit will order more

shopping and even to go to the gym in 2015 i lost a lot of weight and went back to the store to purchase more but to no avail i was able to find them online and again bought all 3 colors this time in a size small same great capris well recently i did gain some weight and again went on line to buy more this time i bought mediums sizing is very consistent to other clothing there is shrinkage but it is minimal would i recommend these absolutely yes ni am 5 7 and the hems go to just below my knee caps they are straight legged vs pegging at the knees very flattering if i had to change anything about the capris i would add slash pockets i do miss not having pockets great fit nicely made with perfect medium thickness love the stripe great buy for sure i wear a 14 and i bought the 16 so they d be a bit loose i am a short person capris usually fit me like high water pants just above the ankles these fit me the way capris fit taller women this is my second color wish they had more colors and i would buy more i can only find them online and they are sold out a lot of time but they are worth the weight great fit nicely made with perfect medium thickness love the stripe great buy for sure i wear a 14 and i bought the 16 so they d be a bit loose these pants are amazing they fit well around the waist with a drawstring that tightens slightly but not too much the drawstring is s very narrow band of material but it actually holds them up quite well the pants are extremely soft and wash incredibly well i don t put them in the dryer so they shrunk ever so slightly after the first wash i am 5 9 tall and weigh 180 pounds i purchased the xl because most of my height is in my legs and i have athletic thighs these pants are my new favorite they are not too snug in the thighs and do not ride up my thighs when i walk i have worn them to run only once so far since it s still warm enough outside to run in shorts but i wear them almost exclusively around the house working from home walking the dogs etc i have slept in them a couple of times the picture makes them look like they are snug down the leg but they are not for me if my thighs were slightly thicker they probably would i bought two pairs of gray and one pair of black the thin white stripe down the sides are so cute i want to buy more of these these are the same as the danskin brand from several years ago they fit great and are soft cotton this are my go to pants very conformable and always look nice on i have bought several pairs last year and this year ni weight 160 and bought an xl and they are perfect very similar to the danskin now capris very nice quality fit and price cannot find in store the only thing i don t like is the drawstring which is flimsy yayyy i absolutely love my athletic works women s athleisure they fit perfect feel perfect and look perfect i love the 54 cotton 36 spandex material feels nice on my skin love the awesome value for a great quality whet more can i ask for nothing i will buy more for sure better quality than expected soft and comfortable and the size fits as expected ni would have given 5 stars but the vertical pinstriping is set at an unflattering position of course i am more plump than the model but the stripes for me ended up not quite down the side and not down the front but somewhere in between i can live with it but i thought it would be good to add here in case it matters to someone else great strong quality i only bought 2 pairs of athletic works women s athleisure just in case they weren t what i was hoping for thank goodness they are exactly what i needed the seams are nice and strong the 54 cotton and 46 spandex feels good flexible and comfortable now time to shop for the rest of the colors i really wish had alot more colors to choose from though great value for a perfect quality quality material that is medium weight however it makes me look larger i should have ordered a medium i hope to be able to return to my local store i bought one pair of grey shorts because i wasn t sure of the fit or the style or even how much i would wear them i m usually a blue jeans person but after i received that one pair i immediately turned around and bought 3 more grey pairs i m sure the other colors are fine i just happen to like the looks of the grey they fit perfectly and are so very cool and comfortable that i live in them all day long now i would have preferred just an elastic waistband to the drawstring also i would have preferred more cotton these are great the material gets better after a couple washings i like the style not too tight on the calf they are flattering comfortable for me to work out on the treadmill at my local y the only thing i would change would be these shorts are soft and comfy i like the knee length but they have no pockets i need pockets always so i will have to sew some on these are my favorite capris i wear them everywhere and have them in every color available fit to size great fit nicely made with perfect medium thickness love the stripe great buy for sure i wear a 14 and i bought the 16 so they d be a bit loose they are super comfortable good material,women's clothing,0

694,Champion Women's Powerblend Fleece Joggers,23.45,4.4,349.0,rock these joggers love these i love champion wearing these daily super comfy lots of compliments not for winter beware if you are petite good just wrong size not truly recommend made big this is what i wanted could use a longer length nice sweats cant wait till its cold to wear great pair of joggers ice cake color is not pink i love them order down great investment cute and comfortable super comfy could be more durable,absolutely comfortable joggers true to the size love these sweatpants best ever i have 5 pairs of them just different colors i bought mediums i m like 5 1 and 140lbs i originally ordered small and found them kinda tight and they have cotton in them so they are going to shrink super comfy and great price i love champion clothes they re always cute and comfy hope to be able to model for them in the future exactly what i was looking for very comfy and good quality i m 5 3 and the small is a bit long but not bad i bought a second pair recommend i love these sweats i got lots of compliments at work and even had someone say they purchased these after seeing them super soft inside and out light weight and not too hot i do a lot of deep cleaning at work and it doesn t make me feel like i m boiling the only con is that if you are curvy while they fit great they do start to have a weird texture where your thighs are rubbing together i m 150 lbs and find most of my pants sweats do this so it s nothing that would deter me from purchasing them again i ve worn them many times and even dried them on low heat and they turn on amazing each time soft warm but it doesn t work for winter maybe for fall the hem of the pants are very wide i thought they were going to be tight to my ankles i love these joggers and have been living in them as the weather gets cooler they are super comfy but still flattering for wfh or running errands in the neighborhood they lose a star for being too long on my petite frame they look more like traditional sweats on me than that polished tapered jogger look i am 5 2 120lb and wear the xs for reference i like them a lot and they are comfortable it s just that i m short but i have big legs so they fit me but are a little long on me other then that they re great this review was collected as part of a promotion too easy to get pill these joggers are made very large i ordered a medium and when they got here they were atleast as big as an extra large regular thick soft sweatpants i want more pairs cant wait to spend all chicago winter wearing em they are alright yes they are everything that the reviews stated the sweat pants need too come in longer inseam for some of us who are 5 9 and over because they are going to shrink and then my money is wasted i purchased two pairs different colors they re alright i wish people thought more of us tall people whom would like longer inseam so when we wash our clothes we can still wear them cause the shrinkage is real and i know they re going to become capri length even if i hand wash in cold and line dry sad face emoji sad face emoji i really like these sweat pants but they were a little snug on the legs and butt i had read a lot of reviews and some people said were big and to size down but i had to actually go up a size oh my but no problem i like them and they feel good on me i purchased these pants matching hoodie in a local store i got the ice cake light lavender not pink the white set is white white the blue sets is navy blue online the color listed as ice cake looks like pink which is the only reason i went searching for the ice cake color set but its not pink like its pictured its lavender which is very light purple i really wanted the baby pink like it looks in the picture but because i was already here i went on ahead purchased the pants run big to me i am 5ft 7 with a behind hips legs abt 180lbs i got the l i tried on the m l xl the m fit was ok fit tight but if the pants shrunk it would be a problem the xl pants were waay to big manly looking on me the pants in this collection have functional drawstrings side pockets the matching hoodie also has the same multicolors spelling champion as well material is soft fleece on the inside cotton on the outside pictures of matching pants hoodie in the ice cake color are attached i absolutely love these joggers they re super comfortable and perfect for lounging around i would definitely recommend them if you re looking for a comfortable yet not to heavy pair of joggers i ordered my typical size very over sized very disappointed that i could not exchange them fir the size i needed sent them back and not reordering the joggers are very comfortable they are high rise something i have been trying to find in joggers for the longest on top of being high rise they are so warm and cute they look good to sleep in to go out as casual or active and super affordable i got these in navy they are really cute and sharp looking enough to wear running errands they are also soft and comfortable i did size down based on previous reviews normally i wear a s m in sweat pants and i got these in an xs i am 5 4 and 118 pounds the fit was perfect not at all baggy but not too tight i ve only washed them a few times but they are holding up nicely no fading no pills no shrinking i can recommend these they are nicer than a lot of the higher priced champion sweat pants and i love the logo on the leg these sweatpants are super comfy and started off very soft inside the only downside that i have found is that the soft insides pill and fuzz in the drier right away and the inside of the thighs pilled almost immediately by the 2nd time i wore them there were pills in the inside of the legs,women's clothing,1

696,"Womens Comfort Front Close Sports Bra, 3 Pack, Style 96014D",23.82,4.5,286.0,very pleased again 5 star sports bras a bra that is for anyone sport or casual wear comfort comfort comfort great comfy bra s easy on need pads in all three bras misleading ok but not great not impressed good bras but bad order checking great for limited shoulder mobility short waisted these bras are for you trying to deal with sports bras that are too tight bras so comfortable you forget you re wearing one just right easy comfortable support perfect for me the best ever nice material but sadly it doesn t fit me,this is the second time i ve ordered these bras and they are great as a 63 year old woman hooking my bra in the back was very difficult with these i just hook them take them off and on over my head the fit is much better than those sports bras with no hooks i have bought these before after a breast surgery and now i wear them all the time so soft full coverage true to size and love the front closure highly recommend these bras you will love them very comfortable for any type of life now this is my go to bra stretch bras offer no support these fasten in the front or easily pull over your head due to a shoulder injury i could no longer comfortably put on or off tank styled exercise tops after reading the reviews for the flm front close sports bra thank you ladies regarding sizing up i purchased size 38 although i wear a 34b because obvious from my sizing i really don t require much support but want comfort especially when exercising aerobics where breathing hard is normal i m 74 this sports bra is to die for i ve used others with snap on fronts zipper fronts and none are 1 2 as comfortable as this bra i love this sports bra in fact i think i m going to wear it at home as an everyday bra it s so comfortable i plan on purchasing more so i have them on hand during wash days and hope as the reviews suggest they last a long time even with washing and drying thanks to the previous ladies for their reviews and as they suggest for ultimate comfort size up gals this is a great product and the price is less then a quarter of what you d pay for a decent bra try it and you ll love it great bra s for the money they are light weight and do not feel like they are going to cut you in half great for hot summertime weather and i am a plus size woman i love these for at home wear doing my chores they move with you feel like wearing a soft comfy t shirt the only thing is i do not like is the three set of bras come with only one set of pads i thought all three bras would have a set of pads other than that they are very comfortable however i still need help getting them on and hooken for i am disabled black bra is padded nowhere in description does it say one out of three would be padded doesn t make sense i m full figured the last thing i need is a padded bra first these bras are not as tight as i would expect my size to be for a sports bra second the bottom of the fabric panel where the hooks are has a rough edge that tickles and irritates the entire time i am wearing it i thought maybe this problem was just with one bra in the package of three maybe it was a sewing mistake i thought but so far both that i have worn have this annoying problem also in my pack the white and gray have no padded support while the black does i suspect perhaps that the padding can be removed from the black and used in one of the other two if the wearer prefers it s kind of a cheap way around really there is one set of inserts for the 3 bras to share but more importantly the front closure is very noticeable when wearing a t shirt sweatshirt or a sweater i like these bras but when i got them this time one of the 3 was padded had no idea they made them padded unable to return until covid is gone but will when able do not need a padded bra the other 2 are fine but have to return all 3 so i can t wear any of them bummer staff should check i have problems with both shoulders and back fasten bras were no longer working for me these bras are very easy to get on and off causing me much less pain great for under casual clothes and wearing around the house these come with a removable insert if you like a bit more coverage i highly recommend these bras im very short waisted and these bras worked beautifully for me i wasn t tugging or pulling all during the day trying to keep things in place very pleased with this purchase my previous fruit of the loom sports bras bought from walmart several years ago size 36 are nfuller in fit than these new ones ni have not gained weight same size for many years nam trying to deal with this discomfort nwe are avid walmart shoppers and you asked and i told i will have to say that these are the most comfortable bras i ve ever worn they don t bind and are comfortable enough to sleep in if i didn t know i had one on i would never have realized it as it feels like i m not wearing one it is easy to put on especially for one who has mobility problems reaching around to fasten a traditional bra my only problem is by only ordering by the size around and not by cup size it kind of tends to make you look like you have a uniboob unless you put the extra liner in the cup so you actually have some form i don t generally wear a padded bra as i don t need one but this helps to give the cups more shape they only included one set of liners so you have to remove and replace with each bra i would have preferred a choice in the colors but for the price they are great for wearing around the house or casual dress i purchased these sports bras for use after my breast reduction surgery they are perfect comfortable and convenient the front closure made changing my bandages easy provides the support needed to help the breasts heal properly would definitely recommend these bras are comfortable and easy to wear i leave them fastened and slip them over my head i liked them so much that i went back and bought more the white ones are a bit tough to keep white because of the absorbent material but i love the fit and comfort as does my mom in memory care the bra fits perfectly and is very comfortable i am having a lumpectomy soon and this bra was recommended to wear after surgery including while sleeping i am sure it will be perfect also i appreciate that is has normal straps as opposed to the racer back straps on other sports bras the 3 pack is a good value with a nice choice of colors the best casual sleep bra ever someone mentioned the black has padding and they were not happy all three bras have a accessible pocket to add or remove the padding the material is very soft but sadly this bra doesn t fit me comfortably i m a 34f and ordered a 36 which should have been my corresponding size according to the provided chart i m not going to try going up to the next size 38 while it might fit better in the cups i think the band would be too loose so it s back again to searching for a good wirefree cotton bra,women's clothing,0

stomach in they are priced great i have more coming i really like these panties n nthese are high waist full panties obviously do not order these if you want less material and do not want granny panties also these just try to smooth out the tummy do not order these if you want spanx like tummy control if you want sucked in control please shell out 6x the price for spanx n n this review was given not as a part of any promotion lol i got a size large and it was a perfect fit i m 160 pounds postpartum and 5 2 these were great to wear after my c section because they avoided my incision and was great to also help smooth my tummy after having a baby the material is nice and mesh is not itchy and has inner lining to not get caught on the incision the only area that slightly squeezes is the band around your midsection after you have been wearing for a long period of time but pretty comfortable otherwise over all i really like this brand of underwear and just discovered these tummy control ones they are super comfortable and not tight at all i like that they do not roll down when i sit or bend down i purchased 2 packs since the variety of colors are great these are so nice they looked really thin big and no way they are going to smooth anything too thin when i took them out of the package but the first time putting them on they were great soft no lines and really does smooth the tummy without being a shaper i found these to be at least near true to size i have nothing negative to say about them they do help smooth the tummy since there is a little bit of a middle panel design to them the colors and designs are nice love this product as it give me the support needed and no panty lines it pulls in my stomach with just the right amount of support with out feeling like a support garment that can feel like rubber sucking you in the only thing is it s hard to find size 7 in local store and i didn t see an option for delivery i came across this during a normal visit to store and purchased i went back and bought two more sets they need more color selections i went home and threw out all of the cotton underwear i had as this was a much better value and product easy to wash and care for they fit really well the tummy control is a bonus i ve ordered more warner makes a quality product with a great price very smooth fabric size is true they are nice to wear with jeans leggings dresses skirts practically anything i especially like that they don t ride up or pinch the waist legs inner thigh etc this review was collected as part of a promotion this product is amazing i have a muffin top like most woman don t want to say but this product helped me hid it and still makes me feel sexi i love this product i recommend this to all of my friends and family this review was collected as part of a promotion i tried the tummy smoother briefs the front side of the briefs have a very stylish design that helps with the fabric looking smooth on the skin the briefs are stretchy but the elastic bands keep it in place they are high waisted and provide full coverage the gusset is made of cotton while the rest is made of polyester elastic and nylon they are very comfortable and help with smoothing the stomach area this review was collected as part of a promotion these panties are not for me maybe others could wear them and like them but they are just so large and awful i wish i had better descriptive words that didn t sound so brash but i just didn t like anything about these panties and there was so much material these panties are nowhere near flattering this review was collected as part of a promotion beautiful panties for my age and weight i m 5 4 190 lbs pear shaped i got the large which fits a bit more snug than the xl i also npurchased but the xl is comfortable and fits nicely everywhere these are very silky and sexy panties i love the color choices and they wash very well my only issue is the seam on the right of the brief it digs into me a little seamless would make these 5 stars i would order again though this is my first time ordering this brand and i love the comfortable fit so i had to get all the other colors comfortable but no tummy firming i bought a medium size based on the size chart should have gotten size small i love these super soft yet hold you in good they dont roll down or ride up i love warners brand i have bought there stuff for years and still love there brand tried several makes and models of a support panel panty including some with big names and price tags this is the winner by far,women's

702,"Hanes Women's Cool Comfort Cotton Low Rise Brief, 6-Pack",9.47,3.7,704.0,great fit good coverage in comfortable panty what i wanted but not the colors inconsistent sizing poor quality do not buy they shrink def not as listed don t waste your money used to the the best a tad bit small fabric not as soft as i wanted quality of women s underwear uncomfortable good and good price hanes low rise briefs my favorite thinner elastic than same style last time just what i wanted familiar style cut and fit,these panties are some of the best i ve ever purchased i m a long time wearer of hanes i prefer the low rise as they sit right on my hips level with my belly button making them not so low they slide off my backside or so high they look like big girl panties lol n ni believe these actually run a tad large as i started to order a size 10 46 47 my exact hip measurements decided to order a size 9 44 45 which is what i normally wear i m 5 2 weigh 175 most certainly have hips thighs real women have curves so i m looking for comfort not something that is going to squeeze me to death the size 9 fit purrfectly the waist is comfortable the leg openings fit well the band material isn t scratchy which is nice the high cut panty makes your leg look slimmer which is a real plus n nthe one thing i noticed is that the seat of the panty is a little loose but i know that will change as there is always a little shrinkage when they are washed it s not major these do hold up very well when going through any number of washings i keep enough in my wardrobe to wear one a day i have some that are more than a year old that are wonderfully soft on the skin but still look almost brand new they just get softer each time they are washed i use tide oxyclean in warm water dry in a delicate cycle n nthe color combination in the 6 pack was great so no complaints about what i received see pictures n ni recommended these to my daughter granddaughter who are always complaining about undies that ride up are uncomfortable they are both big gals they love them as much as i do because they stay in place no matter how long you wear them or how active you are n ndon t ever take these off the shelves hanes you ve got a good thing going on with these i m going to order another couple of packages so i have plenty on hand being a former wearer of bikini style underwear i found that after having two kids i wanted more coverage in a panty but didn t want to lose the lightweight feel of the smaller style underwear these fit to your body well don t ride up have plenty of coverage for your bottom but don t come up too high on your belly whoever invented tagless styles is awesome because no one likes tags wide assortment of colors in each package to suit lots of tastes and outfits great value for the money these are great and i m happy i found something in between the super low rise hipster bikini cut and the full on briefs these are a good mid rise yes some of the pairs in the same pack fit differently than others from the same pack but they re inexpensive cotton undies i didn t really expect more i m happy with the prints i got and i m so happy they re available on walmart com since i couldn t really find them anywhere else i wanted nude white or black but that option wasn t available i didn t know what was coming i didn t like that but it was the only option when they came both packages were the same and bright colors and prints no nude i would like the option to pick the colors i ve worn hanes brand panties since i was a teenager i m 60 now i always stayed with hanes because they were well made and i knew i could purchase the same size in any style and they would fit i can no longer say that i ve found that not only does each style run different in sizing but panties within the same package are different when panties from the same package are compared to each other there may be anywhere from half an inch to one and a quarter inch difference in their waist size i ve also found that the quality is no longer as good hanes panties used to last for years now you re lucky to get one maybe two years from a pair i will say that the bra i purchased fits ok and at least for now it appears to be well made i hate how much hanes brand products have changed the quality of the product is no longer there sorry but you asked i am updating my review i wish these underwear came in all white but they do not i am upset because after purchasing i put into the washer dryer and they have shrunk up so horribly others have said that there isn t a 2 layer liner but the ones sent to me do have that i do not recommend these my first disappointment with walmart com as you can see from the photos below the bright colors and flowery designs are not what is presented on line there was no receipt to request a return these say they have a 2 layer cotton liner they do not the material is much thinner than in previous years i don t understand why any underwear company would not put in a comfort liner over the stitching in the crotch i searched every style of hanes in retail stores as well and none of them had the extra lining piece needless to say i switched brands i have hanes underwear in this size these are like 2 sizes too small and the fabric on the printed ones is so awful they re neither soft nor flexible i wanted to send them back but they charge for it so i ll just donate them awful will never order online from them again i have bought the same underwear for years hanes cotton stretch women s low rise briefs with comfortsoft waistband i love them i tell others i have been a repeat customer for at least 8 years now in the last year i have tried to buy more i have gone to 3 different stores in case i just got cheap ones once but no they are all bad what have you done hanes the fit in the butt under your cheeks is all wrong they totally ride up and don t cover like the old ones the waist band doesn t stretch it just breaks the thread and shreds from there see attached photo its a good value but the fabric is slightly dry or scratchy not super soft also order one size up im pants size 2 or 3 usually but if i follow walmarts size chart i should be between size 4 6 however size 5 i can wear without any pain but tbh when i put the panties on i still feel like the leg holes are too small i dont feel it when i sit but yeah for comfort sake just order a size up if ur a small like me with normal thickness legs then order medium or size 6 i ve been a lifetime hanes wearer no more the last several orders have been horrible the fabric is thin stiff the elastic is not tight and the fit is off i was hoping you would go back to your old ways but evidently that s not going to happen so unfortunately i have now placed my first order with your competitor hopefully you ll bring back the quality you had for many many years felt they were cut a little small i always buy a size 8 but these felt a little smaller will size up the next time size runs small rough scratchy waist elastic which has little elasticity to it fabric is not soft feels like the design was painted on i bought 1 size larger than my usual size but that didn t help i like them because they re cotton which seems hard to find anymore these are ok but they re not what i thought they were i have some that are getting old so was trying to replace them i used to loved these they are not the same waist band they are now an exposed elastic which is why i loved these to begin with the elastic used to be covered with material and soft these are the best i love the wider cotton waistband i wish they were not so hard to find in stores around me it s rare to find in my size 6 or 7 my old hanes had a thicker elastic waistband and leg elastics these are thinner elastics and feel a little tight in the area between the top of my leg and groin so i m not as comfortable because i at times become aware of these underpants these are nice i do wish they came in all white others have said that these don x80 x99t have a 2 layer liner but mine do i gave 4 stars only because they are not as nice as they used to be fabric a bit thinner elastic not cloth covered but very happy to find my fave style cut and fit,women's clothing,0

705,Sweet Nothings Women's Stay Put Strapless Push Up Underwire Bra,13.94,3.8,152.0,nice bra best fitting strapless bra it will do nice bra not very comfortable falls down too much content nice bra get this bra girl good support beautiful and comfortable way too small,i really like this strapless bra i wear a smaller size and it definitely gave me a great shape and push up this bra stayed in place the whole day and i love that it come with straps if needed a bonus is that it is cute too i should have got this a long time ago best fitting bra like this ever and i love the fact that it comes with straps too nice fits perfect true to size everything was great as far as price and style but the size was too small for what i had ordered i couldnt use it for the wedding that i was going to attend i ended up giving it to a family meme we because it didnt fit its a shame because it was a pretty bra and excellent price and fast shipping i had to order this online so i had to decide on size based off or reviews multiple reviews said to order a larger cup and larger band i have band extenders so i decided to order my usual size i did not need my extenders it fits well the cups are actually larger than i need even though i ordered what i wear in every brand and style of bra i would prefer it to be a tighter fit as opposed to loose and creating a gap at my chest when i move into certain positions it will do my suggestion order your usual size or try in in the store if you can for refernece i am a 34 c and small body type i bought this bra to wear with tops and dresses that i could not wear a traditional bra with i will say it is high quality and feels sturdy it has some type of elastic band attached to the band of the bra maybe to help keep it from sliding it does run a little small as i felt the 34 was tight on me but again maybe its so it doesnt slide down overall it is a good bra for the price not quite as comdotable as i would like but still works it was a comfortable fit and when i wear strapless bras they always fall but this bra stayed in place it s okay it holds everything in place but it can be a bit uncomfortable with the wires poking you through the material nice bra but disappointed because it didn t say that it was padded and i dont need nor like a padded bra it fits a little snug and i wear a 36 and went up to a 38 the bra keeps falling down of course was really hoping this one would work to stay up without the straps but it did not and the fact that its a push up it pushes your boobs up but it looks weird from the side view great bra stays in place great bra and great price good for a small breasted woman its hard to find a nice push up bra in a small size i have went my whole life without a strapless bra because i could never find one that fit right or actually held me up properly this bra is amazing i now for the first time in my life feel comfortable wearing one and wearing strapless shirts life changing yall it stays put and everything and so cheap i got my regular size too 36dd and its perfect good support good price bra stays up doesn t fall down can not say enough nice things about this bra great fit and comfort great size and fit feel great wearing them all day great fit and comfort shipped quickly love this bra very comfortable wow they are the perfect fit and size very comfortable wearing them as well no way was this bra a 36 it s tighter than my 34,women's clothing,0
706,Time and Tru Women’s Puff Sleeve Crewneck Pullover,9.99,4.2,74.0,best sweater ive ever owned so glad i ordered this size down a lot awesome size down pretty meh meh nope great sweater lovely sweater high quality nice sweater too big darling sweater true to size i reccomend this sweater,favorite purchase ever from walmart i dress exclusively from wm target and staple pieces from on i am a teacher so my items have to carry from work to weekend ordered this in the camel color and fell in love got online and ordered it in every single color worth every penny i normally wear womens large 10 12 and a large in this was just oversized enough photo attached is of my daughter in one of her favorite wm sweaters as well both time just received this sweater the quality is amazing especially for the price the color is beautiful i ordered a larger size than i needed and it is true to size but i m going to keep it and order a smaller size in a different color and wear both of them this sweater is great with reservations i am between a l and xl i first ordered an xl and it was laughable how huge it was seriously the sleeves hung beyond my hands by 6 inches it looked like you could fit two of me in it i reordered it in a medium 2 sizes smaller than my normal size and it fit perfect like the model i am not sure how many more seasons gathered shoulders will be in style but i am hoping it will work for next winter this sweater is one of my all time favorites so nice but does run big size down one size i can t stop wearing this very comfortable and warm i ordered this twice my regular size was looser than i expected returned and ordered a size down now it fits like the model i wish the gather at the shoulders started a bit higher up but i may add a few stitches to give it that look mine fits more like the navy photo but i love the fit shown in the grey photo very soft but a bit larger than expected so i dont hate it but cant say i love it i ordered it online the store in my area is chaotically disorganized and not worth shopping there and got an xxl which seems like is the correct size but the things i dont like may be because its too big so its hard to say the things i dont like are how big it is under the arms when i lift my arms it looks like i have wings but when theyre at my side you wouldnt be able to tell at all id say maybe its because its too big but im afraid if i went any smaller itd be too short for my liking the sleeves are pretty long so you dont really get that bell look but its not outrageous for me at least like i said having gained so much weight i probably wouldnt love how it looks on me even if it were perfect and not going to bother trying a size smaller since im pretty sure it wouldnt make big enough a difference overall its pretty lightweight which i prefer sorry if this is all over the place its not giving me the option to scroll up and edit it to be more cohesive so it is what it is lol bought this for someone but it would have been too short on them material seems fine but i requested a refund super sheer and cheap looking i returned this due to the terrible quality it also made me really itchy this sweater not only looks great but feels great ngreat price for the quality this fit well and looks nice lovely sweater i ordered a large because i wanted roomy oversize fit and it is high quality it is a very nice sweater however it is such a deep blue it looks black the delivery was very fast and the items look great ordered lg but received xxl its huge and looks like a high school cheer leader sweater nnot what i was expecting nor ordered size very impressed with the quality of this sweater and it s very flattering not clingy at all nice sweater fits true to size true to size cute style nice colors the sweater is nice but it definitely does run big,women's clothing,0

709,Terra & Sky Women's Plus Size Wide Leg Pants,12.0,4.4,66.0,great pants these are great nice slacks very nice pants great wide leg pants dressy and comfy too hot for me love em great quality and good fitting pants nice change for me love these pants great pants comfortable pants though too long wide leg pants good pants lovely wardrobe addition,soft good fit looks great great work pants i looooove these pants thw only thing i dislike about them as work pants is i wish the pickets where a little deeper but it dosnt bother me much fair warning if youre ahort like me 5 x80 x994 x80 x9d they tend to be a little long barefooted but work fine with tennis shoes my shoes give me anour an inch and a half loose comfy definitily wide leg which is what i wanted nice fabric too very comfortable i will enjoy wearing them these are soft warm and fit great extremely comfortable these are truly wide leg pants many times i have ordered other wide leg pants only to get them and find that they are too tight on my legs i have the black in 3x and they fit fine i m 5 6 and the length is good with shoes the fabric is knit but it held it s shape and didn t get baggy over the course of the day i m very happy i d like a pair in another solid color i like these pants so well i now have them in average and petite because i didn t notice on the rack nin store that they came in both lengths i m 5 4 so the average fit better with a slight heel for ex boots and the petite are better fit with a flat shoe it s not a major difference in length but a taller person would definitely need average nice pants great quality and price material is not what i expected but otherwise i like them nice fit loose and flowy i like the style but they are definitely polyester and a fairly heavy weight the fabric is not soft or comfortable and they are just overly warm to me i might wear them on cold days but i would not buy them again people who run cold may like them love these pants true to size they fit fantastically well i m 5 10 and it does not look like i m waiting for a flood i bought a back up pair in case they get holes because all my clothes get holes i don t why but i am that one person whose clothes always get weird little random holes in them i don t think normal people would need to buy a back up pair but just in case i mean you know clothes pretty decent pants but i think the run a bit big i am 5 x80 x994 x80 x9d and about 230 lb which pots me in about size 20 22 pants usually i bought 2x in this pant but they seemed quite loose everywhere that is wxpscted for the leg given that they are wide leg pants but not so much for the wasteband it would still be usable but i think 1x would have been better i did buy the petite version and it x80 x99s nice length for an average heel the pant is a bit long it may also be worth mentioning that i bought the same pants in the cheetah print but even though it wa also marked as 2x it was really small mors like an average size 14 16 it appears that the sizing is not consistent 3x in the same cheetah print was quite large so the moral of the story here is that if you order and get a bad pair it nay be a fluke so you could try again and the next pair you get may be just fine bought these pants for my mother she absolutely loves them she has edema in her legs and they swell a lot so having wide legs makes them fit better than a normal pair of pants she said the pants fit well and likes that she could remove the belt if she wanted to another purchase on walmart com that i wasn t sure about i don t purchase many pants jeans because they rarely have my size in petite i tried the pants on twice trying to make up my mind i m between sizes right now so the pants are a little large but was afraid a smaller size would be too tight in places and uncomfortable i ll definitely have to get them hemmed before i can wear them when that s done i think the wide leg will be flattering these pants are flattering and comfortable i purchased 2 pairs and the snake print ones i love them and wear them to work i wish they would stock up on the black and white stripe ones in 4x i have been stalking that listing for months now lol walmart please keep this clothing line forever these are so comfy they re great because they can be dress up pants of casual i m 5 6 220 lb and 0w fit me perfectly 1w was a little big i really like these pants other than that they are extremely long i will need to have them hemmed before i can wear them in public but the quality of the material is good and they are very comfortable love these very comfortable they seem to run a little large on me i m short and wide so that s pretty common will definitely try these in another color laundered very well too i brought 2 pair of these pants in my local store and was pleased with them i washed them to make sure there was no shrinkage i am 5 3 i got petit they did not shrink they are very soft and comfortable to wear i will be stocking up amazing fit for any size interesting fabric great for office or play or evening the blouse that you wear with these trousers will set off the occasion flowy fit so if you are a full sized woman the wear is still superb,women's clothing,0

this review was collected as part of a promotion about a month ago i found a pair of levi strauss co women s plus modern skinny jeans and today i wore them let me say they are the most comfortable

am in love with these jeans they are seriously so cute they fit perfectly very nice stretch and they re super comfy i m really happy with my purchase i no longer feel like i need to wear activewear to feel good all day this review was collected as part of a promotion i received these jeans on oct 21st i have worn then at most 6 times they are not too tight if anything they are a size too big because i have to pull them up continuously while wearing them 11 14 i was pulling them up and heard a ripping sound when i got home and took them off i saw the ripping was at the corner of the back pocket i guess levi s aren t what they used to be love these jeans just the right amount of stretch so they don t get saggy as the day wears on four stars because the seam sewing is rough to the touch and you have to wear a high rise undergarment or tuck in your shirt hopefully this will soften over time but a great fit and a good price ps size up they run a little small very soft and stretchy fits nice the waist sits a little high for a mid rise but not that bad love these pants i got the black color and it is rich and dark doesn t look like jean black they do run the first wash or two so double check no light colors with them these fit excellent i wear between 14 16 but it can be a hit or miss i decided to get 16w and these pants fit well especially around my thighs and hips i don t know how to explain it well but these jeans are wearable if you don t want to waste energy returning them but extremely uncomfortable i mean they fit but at what cost kind of a mess overall 0 10 do not recommend two stars for bare minimum effort i guess signature by levi modern skinny jeans not wat i was expecting i got a pair from the store n they were perfect but this pair nope there supposed to be skinny jeans n tapered to the ankle n these are not the legs from my knees down are huge n look awful on me i m very disappointed i don t know wat happened but these aren t wat i ordered for reference i m 5 2 n 175 n wear a 14w they do run a lil big i ordered a 16w cause i gained a lil weight n they fit up top at my stomach n was perfect except the huge legs from the knees down not good i really wanted these to work i needed a new light colored pair of jeans n they were the right color they just look like clown pants from my knees down oh well returning shipping was very fast however they sent me two sizes too big maybe i mistakingly pushed 26w but i am usually pretty good with making sure of those things because i don t have money to waste wish i had a 22 or even 24 because i can t afford to ship back i really love these pants they fit just about perfect for me they are stylish i ve ordered in a few different colors a lot of times they are out of stock i just wish the long length was just a little longer not everyone is 5 5 the levis were kinda to waist they don t go up high enough i have jean they fit great but not to happy with these i love these jeans so comfortable and stays soft these is probably my 4th pair buying and i love these jeans u want regret it great pairs of jeans fit is true to size and they have a bit of stretch so are very comfortable excellent price and here is 2 days very happy customer,women's clothing,0

new thermal tops the fit for me by fruit of the loom women s plus waffle thermal lounge tops are a great deal this two pack consists of a black crew neck and a white v neck the waffles have definition but they are not deep set enabling you to subtly wear these tops under the smoothest blouses it was 41 degrees out i wore the black one under a thin blouse and i only added a running jacket i was perfectly warm after being washed there is no pilling a super bonus about these tops is they are made from recycled water bottles i got a small size 4 6 and it fit perfectly absolutely in love with these thermals they come in white and black and have an adorable v neck on them which is way cuter than the typical thermal theyre extremely soft and comfy and definitely keep you warm in the winter no air is getting through these thermals and i love that they re cute to wear by themselves i ll definitely be getting me some more i got a size small and they fit perfectly and are true to size no annoying tags very form fitting from hips to waist with no riding up or slipping will fit over a larger bust and also feel snug at the natural waist white fabric seems somewhat thin and a tad sheer but very comfortable without being overly warm bottom hem is loosely stitched very smooth and will not grab at the fabric of overlaying shirts slides inside long sleeves with ease i would recommend both the v neck and crew version prefer the black over white as i could wear the black on its own seams are comfortable there is a little bunching under the arms this is a well rounded shirt that can be used for many uses i e sleeping and lounging i only need this for sleeping when it is really cold outside mid winter use but for relaxing days it is nice to wear and you can still get things done the sleeves can be pushed up and they will stay there so they don t get in the way when you need to do something that makes it a versatile t shirt that can be used for more than a night shirt it is only for a top pajama use it is not long enough to be a one piece wear but the colors available are complimentary to anything it is a good brand name and their products are long lasting and still hold their shape for many years you can purchase their products without trying them on in the package and know you will have a good quality article of clothing that will last till you outgrow it i still have items from them that are still wearable after at least a decade and i just add new items to round out those articles and they still get constant use it is polyester and cotton no fabric softener needed these thermal tops are lightweight yet they keep you warm i walk in the early morning when it is still quite chilled and these thermal tops along with a jacket keep me warm they are a poly cotton blend so they wash up well i do not put in the the dryer the round neckline is comfortable not too tightening around the neck area the v neck not to low the v neck runs a bit larger in the chest which i prefer the black small measures 34 in the chest seam to seam the white v nec measures 36 the size small fits a 4 6 sawoverall i definitely would recommend these fruit of the loom thermals thanks walmart spark review program these thermals make a great accessory a must have in your closet for diversity and texture they offer rich colors and are true to the color shown so so soft and waffle breathable material they use 80 recycled polyester and 20 cotton every stitch neatly in place they are made well the cuffs are ribbed and do keep the cold out the reason for 4 stars is for the size they run small in size i got the next size up and perfect for me the material is kind of thin and also a little sheer depending on your taste i can accessorize and make what i have look like more wearing these thermals i can wear them under a nice blazer or vest the colors and texture pop or wear alone with a nice scarf and a pair of jeans casual look it makes it easy to adjust to any body temperature dress them up or down easy care wash cold tumble dry on low these two shirts are very comfortable it was very nice to get two of them my daughter really liked them especially the red one the sleeves were nice and long so they would even cover your hands if it was very cold out the shirts are well made there were no strings hanging and the seams are durable i like these shirts and they can be worn in a variety of ways they can be worn as a base layer in cold climates also the shirts have a v neck which makes them look good to wear alone they do not look like longjohns another option is to wear as pajama tops they are soft and comfortable so you will feel cosy all night fruit os the loom is a respectable company and i feel confident in their products upon first appearance these thermals look thin and light weight they were thin enough to see light pass through them after wearing them found them to be much warmer then they appear the colors are very nice and work with my wardrobe very well for the most part i was impressed with them the texture was that which you would expect of thermals but they are soft and comfortable i am a bit concerned with the quality one of the shirts had a small hole in it when we got it the hole has not gotten bigger nor have any more holes appeared at this time all in all a very good product that i would buy again additional colors and if the material would be great and a slightly heavier material might be nice for extreme weather conditions i received this product as a member of the walmart spark reviewer program it is getting very cold and will likely get colder so i got these forms wife who really likes them as they are very comfortable the only caveat is that these thermals are a bit baggy on the arm length so it gets annoying when its worn as an undergarment the material is soft but the strechyness doesn t seem like it will stand the test of time from slacking especially around the v neck time will tell the main reason i recommend this thermal is the it keeps you very warm and they come in very nice colors the fruit of the loom thermal tops fit for me arrived by ups they was delivered in a nice thick smaller brown cardboard shipping box there were two thermal tops that were placed in a clear plastic wrapping that was taped closed for transport when placing an order on line the there are different choices of colors and sizes i chose the maroon and gray colored tops the maroon colored top came with a v neckline the gray colored top has a crew neckline the are no tags sewn in with these fruit of the loom thermal tops that can poke or annoy the back of the neck all of the information about the thermal tops are manufactured stamped inside during production which is located on the back of the neckline the thermal tops are made of 70 polyester and 24 cotton so shrinkage is minimal the end results is a very soft cotton like feel waffle texture material that is breathable the fabric is not scratchy it flows on the body and doesn t get stretched out the fabric is produced and sewn together tightly so it will not snag and fall apart when washing use the gentle cycle do not add fabric softener in the washing machine and the low heat in the dryer this helps to keep there shape they are loose fitting not tight lightweight and long enough to cover the mid section to the thighs there is no flap in the back both of the thermals are double stitched on the collar and has some stretch for comfort and it doesn t bind around the neck there are no buttons or snaps to make wearing the tops uncomfortable these thermal tops trap more body heat and makes it ideal to wear during the cold winter months fruit of the loom offers all different types of thermals for the entire family fruit of the loom thermals are made in el salvador i thought 4xl would plenty big enough but it s pretty tight and if it shrinks during a wash i probably won t be able to wear them i like the fact they re made from old plastic bottles and i would buy more items recycled like this the tops are soft and if not for the tight fit they would be perfect most items i get or 3xl or 4xl so you might want to order a size up on these ok so i got my fit for me by fruit of the loom women s plus waffle thermal lounge crew v neck top 2 pack yesterday i gotta say it was disappointing i am a 4x and the sleeves were short as well as the shirt the material is thin i do like the style of the shirts ones is crew neck and the other v neck they just need to b longer a little thicker for me the fit by me thermal shirts are soft to the touch and the selected size fit perfectly it is lightweight and breathable i was comfortable wearing it the neck line on both the round neck and v neck was not tight and fit well around the wrist and did not cover the hand it stayed in place the length is long enough so i didn t have to keep pulling it down the thermal shirt was smooth under my clothing so it didn t even look as if i had it on the stitching on the buttom is thin and when i had them worn inside my pants it was not bulky i washed them and they didn t stretch out of place it stayed like new i even wore it as a longing shirt and had no problems the spandex feel of the shirt stretched and moved along with me i liked the selection of colors available i think it s a great soft to the touch warm lightweight thermal and would recommend to family and friends i give it 5 stars out of 5 stars i was really surprised when i washed this shirt that it did not shrink i have never had a thermal shirt that did not shrink this is really cool and it is very soft it feels really good against your skin the material is a little thinner than i thought that it would be i think that could be because it is made of 74 polyester and 26 cotton that is probably why it did not shrink too i was still warm in it i wore it under another shirt and was warm all day i did not get over heated when i was doing things while wearing it either it kept me just right in temperature i did not give it five stars because i did have a problem with the shirt riding up i tried tucking it in my pants to see if that would help it stay in place but it did still ride up some i did not like the feeling of it getting higher on my neck the body of the shirt could be a little longer i felt like it was not as long as some shirts of this type but the sleeves are a really good length i really likes this i was able to stretch my arm out in front of me and the cuff of the shirt stayed at my wrist i like that the package has two shirts in it and that the package has two different types of shirts my package has a gray crew neck and a maroon v neck i like that you get a variety in one package i am the male sparks reviewer and the crew and v neck tops are for my better half so trying to do the review as she pointed out things to me first off she states they are really comfortable and soft very warming and a great combination of 74 polyester and 26 cotton very stylish and she has the gray crew neck and a burgundy v neck and both look really good made in el salvador for or by fruit of the loom she always orders clothes online just a little bigger size than normal so they for sure fit and these tops are pretty close to a perfect fit by being ordered just a size larger than her normal might be good to know if ordering at walmart com she also mentioned you really don t want a super tight fitting lounging undershirt in most cases and heaven knows she is always right she is very happy with these and you know the adage happy wife happy life i have been buying fruit of the loom clothing for years it was always a brand i could trust for quality and durability that is until now these thermal shirts are scratchy and improperly sized the long sleeves are so long they need to be rolled up the overall length is very short and not long enough to evem tuck in your pants i ordered a 4 x so i could have them be very oversized and comfortabke to sleep in it was all i could do to pull it over my head usuallyi would order a 2 x maybe this oackage was just missized that being said zi do not recommend these fruit if the loom thermal shirts i really liked the white long sleeve top to sleep in the material is soft and cozy the black round neck top is great under wool sweater since some of mine are itchy both tops are 20 cotton 80 polyester which makes them perfect to be worn under sweaters in winter i was disappointed in the quality of these tops they are labeled as thermal but i did not find they provided any warmth the fabric is too porous for a staple wardrobe item the unfinished hem is not going to hold up to many washings the sleeves were too short for me i would not purchase in the future as i did not find anything that i liked about these tops sweat shirt this shirt can be worn as an undergarment for warmth without sweat consumtion or sticky irritation furthermore this stylish great fit thermal shirt can also be used for entertainment purposes or social outings and many accasions i feel very comfortable in this shirt because it fits well and it is extremely soft i am happy with the durability and strength of the fabric including the moisture management fit for me women s thermal shirt is comfort styling and durable for my daily activities this

839,"Wonder Nation Boys School Uniform Super Soft Flat Front Shorts, Sizes 4-22, Slim, & Husky",3.0,4.6,245.0,great quality great price great fabric great uniforms excellent quality good quality uniform great shorts with adjustable waist quality and enough stretch need dryer sheets runs small great shorts with adjustable waist sizing runs very small excellent shorts you may need to size up one size cut slim good affordable option for school very nice quality great for little boys great shorts for school,these shorts are a good quality product they are well made as the seams look precise and neat they have an always useful adjustable waist tag free four pockets and they are made with stretch fabric for added comfort my son said they are comfortable as a mom i can say that i am happy about the quality they look good feel good and they have a great price i received the school uniform flat front shorts in a charcoal grey color these shorts could be used for school uniforms but they would also be good for a dressier occasion or church the shorts are a very nice deep charcoal color that is a neutral that would go with anything they are a great nice quality fabric that is also very soft my favorite feature on these shorts is the adjustable waist you used to only see the button adjustable waist on the higher end children stores but not anymore you simply adjust the button inside the waist band and you are able to accommodate several sizes my child is on the thinner side so this is perfect for helping the pants fit i will also note that these shorts are a great softness and wash great they were wrinkle free even after sitting in the dryer for awhile the top has a tab closure to make it easier for little fingers i think a button is too hard at that age so perfect addition the fabric on these is non wrinkle and such a great quality do not feel thin at all but great for every day wear these bermuda shorts are thick and well made i can tell they will handle many machine washes they have four pockets and come with an adjustable waist elastic belt in the inside i like that wonder nation offers all sizes even for husky kids these shorts come in khaki navy and black i like everything about these shorts i will definitely buy more if i need to these wonder nation slim boys school uniform super soft flat front shorts are great they are well made wash and dry nicely be it on the clothes line or in the dryer my grandson loves the feel of the material and says they are comfortable to wear the shorts look very sharp on him yet casual too these are perfect for school dress or play they are excellent quality shorts i got these to match a polo u inform shirt i got my nephew and they looked super cute on him he doesn t have to wear uniforms but he likes to dress nice it looked perfect with his red shirt and they looked great even after been washed very good quality clothing uniform shorts strechy and big it has adjustable bottoms for boy this size is 12 gray color good quality the material is soft wash in cold water these are great shorts i love the adjustable waist my son has a dress code at school and these work perfectly they wash great and wear great highly recommend very nice material does not attract lint nnice fit grandson liked pants and agreed nto wear them he looked great with the fit on him size was perfect i got the 10 slim for my son because he has a slim waist these are adjustable waist pants and they are adjusted by the inside buttons on both sides of the shorts these adjustable straps inside the pants have the end sewn into the shorts so if they come unbutton or something the adjustable strap won t disappear inside the shorts they have a button and zipper closure and two front pockets and two back pockets they have loops for a belt and measure about 17 inches long from waist the end of the leg i got black and i just threw them in the wash you need some kind of static cling stuff because everything and it s mother will stick these shorts just fyi other than that the shorts are soft and flexible but thick enough to hold up after weekly use this review is for the wonder nation slim boys school uniform super soft flat front shorts first off they weren t kidding when they say these are slim boys my son is 9 and he is only 2 lbs above being considered underweight so he is pretty slim and these shorts didn t fit him he had to suck in as much as he could just to button them and i got the size 10 so they should have definitely fit him so i would say they run very small i guess i should have gotten a size 12 it was disappointing too because i was hoping to use these along with a cute shirt i got him for his school picture day tomorrow but i had to search for a different option for shorts if they did fit him i would probably recommend but being as he was really not able to use them there isn t much to go by in terms of how good they are or how comfortable they seem to be a good material thought and not thin they do adjust but that does not do anything helpful if they are already to small that only is beneficial if they start out being to big the size issue has nothing to do with the quality though as like i said that seems to be up to par and for that reason i would recommend as not everyone will have the same issue we did just be aware that you may need to order a size up these shorts are great i love the adjustable waist they wash great and wear great my son has a dress code at school and these are perfect highly recommend size runs extremely small my child has been wearing a size 8 shorts by the same brand name for the past year so i ordered a size up to a size 10 i ordered the slim size thinking that it would just be smaller maybe in the thighs but not in the waist when i got them i cut the tags off and washed them thinking they were ok and tried them on my child only to find out that they were incredibly small the button to the buttonhole was probably a good inch apart and that was with the side extenders on the waist all the way out now i am out 50 beware of the sizing excellent shorts i bought 4 pair for my boys very good quality cut and style you may need to size up one size they run slim super soft they are stiff not soft and don t have as much room as the navy ones we purchased i kept them out of desperation but i know my son wont be able to wear them long they seemed to be constructed well fit perfect and look great had to sew fake button back on both pairs but not too big a deal have a similar pair of old navy shorts and they are just as good i purchased the shorts for my grandsons for school they are excellent quality the length is also very nice i was also pleased with the available sizes great purchase i am very happy with wonder nation clothes in general and have found them to outlast other brands and be of good quality i like these shorts because they are cotton good quality and very reasonable in price thank you wonder nation wonder nations clothes are always of the highest quality with a low price i buy these every year for my son for his uniform they hold up well for a little boy that gets use out of his clothes have used these for school for the last 4 years true to size good fit material wears well fades slightly after several washings but good for a whole school year perfect for school uniform i love that the waistband is adjustable since my son is tall but skinny,boy's clothing,1
840,"Wonder Nation Boys School Uniform Super Soft Stretch Twill Flat Front Pants, Sizes 4-22, Slim, & Husky",5.0,4.5,382.0,durable and comfortable long but easy fix love the dual layer in the knee area durable and comfortable perfect uniform pants great boys uniform pants great value runs small good product good quality attracts lint boys khakis reinforced knees nice pants sturdy pants solid pair of pants good quality uniforms uniform flat front pants great pants really nice but are longer in length than usual great deal,these school uniform pants are very good my kid loves that they are thick but not stiff the color is perfect for camouflaging light stains and dirt the hidden elastic belt allows it to be shrunk to her waist because her waist is so small it creates ruffles and makes it look puffy which she likes my favorite part about the elastic belt is that the ends are sewn into the pant so there s no risk of losing them when pulling too hard it is also a bit on the long side but she just tucks in the seam and she s good to go i know this pair of pants is for boys which would explain why they re too wide and too long my girls have been raised with boy clothes because they are more durable than the equivalent in girls considering that my girls act like boys and like climbing trees sliding on the grass jumping fences etc boys pants last them much longer than girls pants plus i usually get clothes that allow room for them to grow to cut down on our clothes budget these pants are great for our needs we have a very short son who wears a size 4 these are really long on him we had them hemmed up by a friend and they fit perfect too long is a very easy fix and can be taken out when he grows these pants are perfect for little boys they have stain release wrinkle free and reinforced knees for those little men who are overly active we love these pants they have not lost there color from washing i highly recommend these for your sons school uniform to last all year long wonder nation boys school uniform flat front pants holds up to its name it is definitely very soft it is made of 98 cotton and 2 spandex not only the pants is soft but there is a dual layer material around the knee area the material used inside of the knee is even softer than the rest of the pants this is perfect because kids pants tend to wear and tear around the knee area often this dual layer will definitely protect the boy s knees i have posted a photo showing the inside of the pants where the dual layer cloth is located it doesn t look very nice inside but i guess it doesn t really matter because no one will see the inside great design wonder nation boys school uniform flat front pants do not wrinkle easily and uses super soft cotton spandex stretch twill another great feature i really like about these pants is the adjustable elastic waistband kids grow fast if you buy a little bigger sized pants and the waist do not fit you can always tighten the waist line if necessary i have washed these pants several times already and the color have not faded at all these pants are soft comfortable and durable the wonder nation boys school uniform flat front pants has a great design and are made of very nice materials lastly they look absolutely great the wonder nation uniform pants for boys are really nice it has a flat front which is easier to iron and a more modern fashion look i usually like to purchase the pants a little bigger than what my son usually wears so they can fit all school year these pants are perfect to use for two sizes since they have adjustable elastic waistbands that can be tighten or loosen to grow with your child s waist the fit is not too baggy as it comes in a straight cut the knees are reinforced with a think fabric in the inside making them harder to rip my son always seems to eat through pants as they rip from the knees very fast but with reinforced knees the pants last longer the fabric has a little stretch in it since it is 98 cotton and 2 spandex the material is strong and thick but they are not a hot material i feel like the stretch will also help them last longer and not get ripped easily as well as allowing my son to move more comfortably through his day at school they are wrinkle resistant they still get a little wrinkled but not it isn t as noticeable as other wrinkled material i have attached a picture of the elastic waistband and reinforced knees i received these boys wonder nation school uniform soft flat front pant for my daughter to wear at school that requires her to wear uniforms immediately i knew these were good quality school pants by the fabric the fabric is soft but thick and structured well my daughter wears uniforms to school and these are a great quality and fit her nicely she wears a size 6 in girls pants and these are a size 5 in boys which she fits perfectly sometimes the size 6 uniform pants are on the looser side there is an inside stretch band to tighten the waistband these pants have a reinforced knee which is fantastic and they have stain release technology and they are also wrinkle resistant i do not iron so this is major deal for this mom the price is decent as well i have paid much more for other band uniforms only to have them stained and worn out quickly and for this price with all these extras the price is fabulous i would absolutely recommend these uniforms i really like these soft khaki boy uniform pants they are made of 98 cotton and 25 spandex you machine wash the pants in cold water and tumble dry low they hold up well in the wash i received size 8 they fit true to size and are roomy enough to bend and stretch in the knees have soft patches on them to reinforce them it has slit pockets on the front and back the pants have an adjustable waist they come in four different colors they have a great price my son is six years old and has a tall slender build because of his height he needs a size seven or eight for length most pants come with the adjustable waist to make the larger size work for him when i ordered these i ordered a size seven to give him the length he needed surprisingly they were a little longer than normal we actually had to roll them up twice for him to wear them but the waist runs very small he almost can t latch them closed they do have the adjustable waist however we have no need to use it with the size being smaller than usual he says they fit fine and do not bother him so as long as he feels comfortable he can wear them never fear there are really good qualities about these pants the quality of the fabric and make of the pants is very good after several washes they still look and feel as good as new i actually like them better than some of his other more expensive uniform pants other brands tend to be made of a heavier fabric which is no good here in florida and they can feel stiff he definitely likes that they aren t like that bottom line the pants are a great price and value but when you purchase be sure to order a size larger than normal overall i was pretty happy with these wonder nation boys school uniform pants i was very surprised at how great the quality of the pants seems to be and how soft they were they also feel very durable but the softness of the material doesn t make them feel stiff they have a really nice stretch to them and i think they re going to really hold up over time i love that there s a stain release treatment so hopefully that will keep them stain free throughout the many wears the reinforced knee patch is a great feature especially for boys and doesn t seem to bother my son at all like other similar products do i love that they are wrinkle resistant so i don t need to iron them the adjustable elastic waistband is an absolute must for my children so this is a vital feature for me the color is a nice dark navy which i m hoping doesn t fade over time the only complaint that i have is that when i washed them the pants attracted fuzz from the other clothes which is not something that happens with the other uniform pants we own overall i would highly recommend these uniform pants to anyone that needs good quality affordable school clothes i like these pants the material and cut are comfortable for the kiddos but the material attracts lint an issue we ve encountered with all dressy pants we ve tried to purchase from walmart if it wasn t for that major factor we would give 5 stars easy care easy wear the wonder nation boys khakis run big in my opinion the waist is adjustable however the pants were still too big everywhere else on my little one i ordered his usual size in other brands the pants do wash and dry nicely without wrinkles if you hang them up right out of the dryer no ironing is needed they are 98 cotton and 2 spandex the material appears to be good quality unfortunately my little one will have to grow some more before he can wear these the button closure is a metal clasp on the inside it is easy to open and close they have side pockets and back pockets overall the pants are nice but i definitely recommend you consider sizing down these pants are made in dominican republic the washing instructions are to machine wash with like colors and tumble dry low you may use an iron on the lowest setting if needed but i find if i take out of the dryer right away i don t need to iron there is no instructions for the washing temperature i received a size 5 as my son is in between a 5 and 6 for length plus i had something else from wonder nation that ran a tad big these fit my son perfect he has a little room to grow in them but they do not drag on the floor there are a few things about these pants that i think make for an amazing pair of pants the first is i love that these pants have reinforced knees my son is very active as i assume all boys are and the knees are the first to go in pants so pants with added knee supports is always a bonus the second is my son is skinny like super skinny so getting pants that fit him in length usually are so big in the waist they fall off of him these have the adjustable waist so i don t have to worry about them falling down the third is these are made with 98 cotton and 2 spandex i am not a fan of polyester myself and think cotton breathes so much better these pants are soft and i am told comfortable perfect pants for school or semi dressy occasions these pants are advertised as being boys pants but i ve had my daughter wear them and they looked super cute on her i would say these pants could easily be unisex they are flat front and the legs flow straight down that means they don t have a shaped leg like boot cut or skinny etc they are reinforced in the knee but not in a bulky awkward way they are a crisp tan khaki and stay true to their color even after washing appropriate sized pockets for children s hands and adjustable inner waist band the adjustable inner waist makes it a huge help when it comes to my child not having to wear a belt they washed easy and didn t shrink they also didn t require ironing a quick wack out of the dryer and then folded makes these pants look neat and straight of course iron them if you re looking for a sharp edged crease but word of caution on that iron on lowest setting if needed reads the instructions on the inside of the pants they are made of mostly cotton and with only 2 spandex the tag on the pants says they are stain release and wrinkle resistant these pants would make a nice addition to any child s school wardrobe uniform or not the wonder nation boys school uniform pants look very sturdy they are navy blue and are size five with 25 inches in length the waist is adjustable which is good when you need a bigger or smaller waist there are four pockets in total two in the front and two in back there is a snap slip button and zipper there is a reinforced knee and belt loops round out the pants i received the wonder nation brand boy s school uniform in straight fit navy blue in a size 4 it is solidly constructed and looks stylish while still being comfortable and durable some details that i love about this pant is that there are four large pockets two in back and two on the side there is also an invisible elastic in the waist with adjustable button holes so that you can take in the waist band a bit if you child is smaller and the item can grow with your child as needed the front button on the pant is decorative and instead there is a metal clasp to hold the pant in place along with the zipper for older kids this is not a big deal but for younger children especially those that are just learning to potty train this is perfect because a simple clasp is so much easier for them to do themselves and really gives a sense of independence to the child i also like how the item is tagless wash instructions are printed right onto the inside of the pant so there are no itchy tags to bother your child i love thoughtful design and i greatly appreciate these small details in clothing the pants are 98 cotton and 2 spandex and can be machine washed and dried on low when the wonder nation boys school uniform super soft flat front pants arrived i was happy to see they are made with almost all cotton and a bit of spandex for flexible comfort while playing i was impressed by how well they are made and the softness of the fabric they have strong belt loops slit pockets on front and back and the waist adjustment tab on the inside the waist adjuster is unlike others i have had in kids pants before it is actually sewn on both sides so you can tighten the waist to the desired button but it you prefer no button adjustment the elastic stays in place instead of getting pulled into the slit never to be found again i picked a size eight since generally my son is wearing an 8 but slightly into 10 they were a bit too small for him in the waist and length i definity should have went with the size ten my son really liked the feel and comfort of the pants though and i m guessing the ten will work perfect i paired the pants with the wonder nation dress shirt as can be seen in the photos i received a nice full catalog in the package that shows all the colors and sizes of all their school clothes i was impressed how inexpensive the shirt and pants are they feel and look like much more costly school uniforms they are soft and they don t seem to wrinkle as bad with the material i would recommend i received these pants through the spark reviewer program but i would buy them as well these pants is great they fit really nice i washed thenm a few times and the color stays and it doesnt fade out the pants are soft and comfortable for every day use and you can use this as a school uniform fit was a little bit small but otherwise look and feel

843,"French Toast Boys School Uniform Pull-On Relaxed Fit Pants, Sizes 4-20 & Husky",14.99,4.7,70.0,great son s favorite pants my son s fave pants but please add slim option comfy pants my little guy love these love the wear of these pants and the price is great great pant my son liked them true husky sizes not husky size great pants best school pants ever i would buy again a little longer than expe french toast is the best husky fit brand great price definitely would recommend great elastic waist pants great pants incomplete description comfortable pants,school uniform pants are generally uncomfortable around the waist but these aren t both my boys love them one is skinny and the other isn t and the elastic adjusts to fit both just fine although my chubby guy went one size up the reinforced knees are a nice touch pants hold up well in the washer and neither wrinkle nor shrink my son s school has a dress code and these are his go to pants quick and easy it s really nice to find pants with an elastic waist and belt loops it s much easier to fit they wash up well not a lot of wrinkles thanks french toast my son loves these uniform pants we also by the pull on shorts they are durable and keep color well knees don t wear out even with heavy playing on the playground we come back to these every year for school uniform shopping only thing that would make these better is if they were offered in a slim fit waist fits great as it s pull on but the legs can appear baggy and a bit sloppy on my slim little guy if i could merge the slim fit of the legs from your standard adjustable waist double knee pant and the waist from these it d be the perfect pant my son loves these pants and the elastic waistband is very comfortable for him these pants are comfy for my little guy i can even get him to wear suspenders my son never complains about his uniform they are comfy and fit well my son plays hard in his pants no issues whatsoever the reinforced knees do help i don t see the thinning around the knees i see with gap or the children s place pants after the first wash the pants get soft very little loss of color after washing many times love these pants bought in size 18 husky and fitted great from his waist but it s very long pant compared to other brands and the fit from the leg opening is very wide for him i will need to make alterations on them i did not wanted to risk on buying regular size since the majority on regular fits him very tight from his waist but great from his legs these were way too big for my son however i feel that was an error on our part he wears 20 husky from store fronts and actually is even too big for 20 husky this brand from french toast appear to be a more accurate husky size we bought the 20 husky and my son s measurements range from 32 34 in the waist i might opt for a 20 regular in this pant next time as the material and ease of wear is good too small in the waist and butt big in the legs and length the pants fit great i did have to size down for my little boy tho great fit good material perfect for his school year i buy these pants every year for my sons they love the slide closure i love the knees that don t wear out easy pull on style great functionality and looks nice for school uniform a little longer than expected but fit great otherwise easy fix by hemming the bottoms the pants were perfect there is lots of room in the thigh area usually when i buy 20 husky for my son the other brands fit snug in the thigh area french toast fits perfect a fraction of the price compared to our local uniform store they are not as thick but my little guy would have been too hot in the thicker material i am happy with my purchase he has only been wearing them for a week and he hasn t taken them off or complained yet i purchased this same brand of uniform pants last year for my son they held up all year he can be rough on clothing typical boy i needed to order new pants because he has grown over the summer definitely would recommend these uniform pants to everyone looking for well made pants for school bought 5 pairs of navy 3 in size 4 5 and 2 in size 6 my grandson is a size 5 slim to average size and the 4 5 size is a great fit will keep the 6 s also he will need them after christmas i depend heavily on reviews when ordering online and decided to order these because the quality and durability were rated great i can say by the looks of the pants they will not disappoint my little fellow looked handsome in his pants and shirts my son loves these pants they wear well and are very easy to put on and take off my only issue is that they are relaxed fit and kind of loose on him it s not worth returning for that but it would be nice if french toast actually indicated that on their website when i called the rep knew nothing about the type of fit these do not look like elastic waist pants from the front the front has a tailored look with a mock fly the elastic is in the back and the fabric is not too bunched up the knees are reinforced the fabric need ironing son reports they are comfortable and his first choice in uniform pants,boy's clothing,0
844,"Goodnites Boys' Bedwetting Underwear, S/M, 44 Ct",26.46,4.5,1464.0,what a steal never leaks great daily and overnight underwear very good protection for bigger kids love these excelent product five five star 3 year old loves best i can find i wish this size was easier to find cautiously optimistic better side materials just amazing embarrassed when it arrived worth it thigh love worth the price,i really love these diapers they hold in urine really well so ur bed doesnt get soaked and im super glad i got so much as i did what an unbeatable price 99 for under 60 dollars these normalls run for a box of 25 upwards of 30 i really think these are good for kids who haven t gotten used to going to the potty trainer i bought the boys design because they were out of girls but i sorta like the designs i feel these can be gender nuetral pampers easy ups started leaking on my 11 yr old so i was recommeneded to try goodnites by a friend of mine n ni am honestly impressed it has been a few months and we have had no leaks n neven last week he had a poop accident and the pull up contained it and it was very easy to change and pull a new one on oh how grateful am i for these underpants we have an autistic son and while he does good most days there are some that are misses and these work wonders i love that they re discreet especially for day wear we put him regular boys underwear on top of these and could not even tell he s wearing one we just love these and will continue to purchase thank you wal mart you have the best prices on these my 7 year old son is the size of a 9 year old so finding overnight pull ups was a bit of a challenge he leaked through all of the other brands that we tried the goodnitrs brand is large enough for his size and has great protection so his bed is not wet in the morning walmart has a great price on this product and fast shipping for when you forget to order and realize your running out i wish i had tried them sooner since he was just a baby my son had to be double diapered down if not he would leak right through his diaper pull up we tried every brand out there and nothing worked til we tried these no doubling up and no leaks i recommend them to everyone i know also a bonus that fsa hsa card covers them since these are pricier than the regular pull ups very confortable it s night time pull up diaper does a good job on a little messy good job getting all of the order good night underwearcomfortable this review was collected as part of a promotion what can i say these are everything a 3 year old boy wants he is so excited to wear spiderman to bed and even more excited when he stays dry mom is too we only had one issue so far with the pull up leaking through but my child is a fish and drank a ton before bed yes they seem a little thin compared to other brands but they do the job my son is autistic 5ft tall 105 pounds he doesn t complain and is a deep sleeper he sleeps 12 hours every night so he wets at least twice in them before waking up they hold most of the pee but we still put a plastic cover over his pull up and a plastic protector on his mattress these are the best pull ups i can find without them being for men the l xl are great for older kids who can t quite fit into adult s and are too big for diapers pullups they fit well and leak only occasionally i haven t found the solution to leaks that s what bed pads and a shower are for fast doesn t take long to change neasy for toddler to pull up and down n absorbent don t have to change in the middle of the night nalso fits well on toddlers bottom i am cautiously optimistic after 1 bad experience and one good with the new designs photo from left to right old design new design case 1 new design case 2 case 1 the bad i bought a case of goodnites l xl for boys a few weeks ago it was my first time buying the new design the space designs look great but compared to previous goodnites l xl the sides were made of a less elastic material and were prone to ripping open the fit was way too tight i nearly gave up on goodnites case 2 the good last week i bought one last case of goodnites l xl to try this case had the new space print and the stretchier side material of the older designs camo and stripes the fit was back to normal and no issues with ripping conclusion i am really really hoping that next time i buy goodnites they are stretchy like case 2 if i get another case of bad ones case 1 i will have to switch to another product i started using these a little over a month ago since my 12 yr old was leaking through the pampers easy ups so i needed to find a new solution i was recommended this product by a close friend so i thought i would give it a try i am honestly impressed with the results we have had no leaks yet and a week ago we had a poop accident and it was very easy to change and clean up i highly recommend this what an amazing product as a teen who wears diapers i had to pick these up at my po box in my neighborhood and when i went to get it it was shipped in a regular goodnites box with no discretion at all and to make it worse around 3 other people were there when they saw me pick it up walking home with a big box of diapers is pretty embarrassing i wish it was sent in a plain brown box instead we arent using these for potty training our tall two year old started to consistently wake up with wet pjs and sheets so we switched to these once we realized they don t make overnight diapers big enough for him its been about 7 months and absolutely no bottom problems or leaking or messes for reference he is now 38 inches tall and 39 pounds and has always worn the medium with hulk on them they were a little big at first but now fit fine he s a heavy sleeper and is in these for 10 12 hours each night with no issues we are so pleased baby 26 pounds wearing the thighs is a little tight it will draw marks and the waist is just right not suitable for babies with thick thighs it s pretty thick so it s perfect for night use my grandson is a what i call a hefty henry we tried cheaper brands but they didn t fit his thighs comfortably he loves these he loves that they keep him dry overnight he s a pretty hard sleeper and cries if he wets the bed if yours is a henry these are worth the cost my two year old is not quite ready for the potty and he is about 43 lb and as tall as a 4 year old so size 6 huggies wasn t doing it i tried the overnight but they didn t hold like you would think considering they re overnight so i tried the good night and an adult could urinate and it would hold easy for a toddler on the run cuz that s what they are always doing he loves the hulk design but he likes the spider man better but they only have it in the extra small so i would like to see more character designs my son is a heavy wetter i had purchased other brands with a lower weight limit and they tended to leak onto his bed overnight after purchasing these l xl goodnites it is a rare day that his bed is wet saves time and money from washing his fitted bedsheets every other day these things are lifesavers i just wish they would either cost less or you could get more for the price,boy's clothing,0

good fit our favority brand for years really good quality i could just throw up love these best brand of training pants moslead pjmasks boy colors for boy s works great best diaper for comfort and value highly recommend pampers products meh will not buy again,these are great the waistband is really good keeps the moister in great i have been using pampers easy ups for a few years now i am on my 3rd child in training underwear these have always worked great i haven t had leakage issues they do not irritate my children s skin my special needs preschooler loves these and they have his favorite characters i love that he doesn t come through the way he did with the pull up brand and other brands my little guy drinks a lot so as you can imagine he urinates a lot as well we dont do it often but one of these easy ups will last him 3 hours through his back to back speech and o t therapy appointments i really like these cheaper then pampers 360 but the same only two things i noticed 1 pampers 360 are softer outside and inside both are equally soft 2 easy ups don t have that blue tape on the back so u can t secure everything in when you dispose diaper we always used pampers diapers for our child and when it was time we transitioned to these easy ups and we mainly use them for overnight and they work fantastic always keeps our child dry and comfortable and no leaks couldnt ask for much more its a great training pants for our lil toddlers easy to pull down whenever they have to go its got all colors of my son s favorite cartoon character pjmask its anti leak so far for me i actually don t really feel the wetness except when its used for longer hours super easy when we need to change tear up the sides and that s it comfortable no squeezing or pinching marks my child likes the characters and the fit when he does pee in them he feels wet not dry like a diaper should encourage kids to use the toilet to avoid that feeling have not had leaks but we change pretty much immediately after an accident we love that our favorite brand of training pants has our son s favorite characters great absorbancy easy for my son to pull up and down easy to tear the sides when he needs to be changed feels softer than other brands closer to underwear ive always trusted this brand because it never gives my kids any irritation we have used pampers easy ups for all of our kids tried other brands but this one keeps baby dry holds up with no leakage and soft and fits perfectly only wish they had a sticky label to seal them close when changing the diaper totally digusted with pampers these have a maze on the front and back of each pull up who thought it would be a good idea to put something in that area for someone to draw or trace on this company should be totally ashamed my son likes pj mask so he likes to put on his training underwear it doesnt absorb as much as a diaper but it is not meant to act as a diaper one of the reasons i like these better then the huggies diapers are the sides they do not have the sides that undo themselves it looks just like underwear so we have to remove them like regular underwear or by ripping the sides i like that it mimics underwear but i do miss the ease of a diaper because with these we have to remove the pants to put a new set on i feel that by not having the plastic sides it fits my son better plus the plastic sides would normally cause cuts or rashes on my sons pelvis so one benefit of these is that they dont have the plastic extenders like a diaper i have loved pampers products since my first was born 15 years ago and pampers has yet to disappoint the easyups are so much better than the other major brand they pull up and down just like underwear and have a nice stretch my kid is happy that he gets to have his favorite characters on them although the price and the fit of the pampers easy ups are on point the colors are not i purchased the 2t 3t boys pjmasks 120 count and two packs of them had pink colors around the waistband and backside i don t prefer nor do i like spending my money on something that looks like it s for a girl when it cleaarly states boys on the box probably won t purchase again misleading i highly recommend these to anyone who uses the pampers 360 diapers these are practically the same product at a better price it so easy to use compared to the pull up that it can detached when pulling up but not these and it don t give my baby rash easily since it stretches way more i got these for my son who we are potty training he absolutely loves pj masks and that is truthfully the only reason that we choose this one because of the characters on it they fit him well easy to get on and off and we dont have any leaks i ve tried so many diapers in the last 3 years with my daughter and i have finally found a diaper that doesn t leak easily fits and goes on she is short and thick and so we have had a lot of problems with chaffing easy ups are awesome we have tried some of the other brands and they do not match the pampers line of products some of the other brands leave you with a wet diaper when you remove them but pampers diapers do not leave that dampness in the training pants i d say the only thing their easy ups are lacking is the strip that lets you know the it s time for a change you have to manually check trng pants feel full or the kid will let you know highly recommend their easy ups and their other line of products its ok i guess they seem comfortable on my baby i usually buy the swaddlers which keep baby s skin dry and switched to this cuz he is a toddler and swaddlers don t fit anymore they had a size 7 but aren t producing them this however leaks sometimes and baby s skin is always wet as if someone sprayed him with water and there is no tape like other brands after taking it off and rolling it it just stays open i might be changing to huggies these get wet and fill up and sag in a bad way size 3t and have to tear

quality sweatshirt granddaughter loves it softy and comfy great hoodie nice hoodie different quality and big size perfect weight size and color serves the purpose great jackets to short poor search engine a good deal the quality of material is what i expected a different product simple lightweight hoodie,i have a small three year old and i was worried the size xs would be too big but it fit almost perfectly i think we will be able to wear it for a couple years the shipping worried me at first because it said it would take about 3 weeks however the product was here in less than two weeks very satisfied the price of shipping and taxes could have been lower though it was almost the same amount as the actual product quality is ok for the price i liked the color choices for these hoodies after red i ordered blue this full zip hoodie is well made durable soft and warm this particular one is lighter weight than others i have purchased through hanes but still pleased with the warmth it provides pricing is reasonable though a lower threshold for free shipping is my preference these zip ups are versatile for the unpredictable weather in my state i have purchased for my 7 year old in many different colors and these are always her go to for outdoors until it s winter coat weather great for warm days too when she is in an air conditioned school building and ties around her waist when playing outside when she gets too warm i bought several of these for myself and the range of colors is great and they are heavier then the ones i bought several years ago like the softness of them the way they stand up to washing the comfortable fit and more of the old designs that i had as a kid from these hooded sweatshirts way to go hanes i literally wear them every day thanks you andi z bought a few of these hoodies for both me and my son and omg they are super warm and comfortable definitely ordering a few more colors for the both of us 10 10 would recommend good quality sweatshirt holds up well and maintains its color i originally ordered navy last year for school uniforms and this year i ordered the next size up i bought this for my 6 year old granddaughter from sc she s visiting here in nj and it got cold this is perfect for those chilly mornings and evenings here and winter when she gets home it s a little oversized on her but she s little and will get at least another year of wear for the price and the little girl ones were either sold out or too flimsy my son loved it s comfort and how soft it is inside very pleased with this hoodie especially for the price it is well made the zipper works smoothly the pockets are deep enough for a kid s cold hands the small fits my 6 yr old perfectly it is soft on the skin a 50 50 cotton poly blend hello got the items thanks when i ordered on your website showed for ash 100 cotton now you modified and for light steel 90 cotton 10 polyester but the real items i received are both 50 cotton 50 polyester also the size charts for boys are similar to the ones for girls but the same size xl for boys is much bigger than the one for girls perfect weight for most of our cooler south east texas winter weather the color is right for our school uniform fits just right and we are all ready to go my 7 year old grandson loses his jacket 3 4 times during jacket season so i keep these in inventory not expensive but does the trick i love these jackets for my kids the are heavy enough for early morning walks to school but light enough to wear throughout the day plus they come in plain colors that match their school uniforms very nicely made nice soft fleece a great bargain amd much better quality than my adukt female hanes zip jackets i order this girls in xlarge i ordered a boys in large the large was alot bigger than the xlarge was not pleased be aware when you start a search for a item it brings up a variety of random items thinking the hoodies are for men but they were kids i ended up with the wrong hoodie this jacket is well made and costs less than all the others i looked at soft and comfortable the zipper is metal i didn t think they made them anymore i expected a somewhat thin polyester fleece material with a zipper and hood it just seems to run small my 8 year old usually wears a size 7 or 8 with the size 8 being a tad big so to allow lots of room to grow i bought a size 10 it fits like a size 8 and he ll outgrow it in just a year i am considering an exchange for a larger size this jacket was perfect but i have a problem with something i bought a shorter time ago i puchest 4 bras in a deal you were having and one of the bras is fraying really bad so much i can t wear it a gray pullover bra in 3x can anyone help me i love it so if anyone has a suggestion please let me know lightweight simple no frills hoodie as well as expected for the price seems to have a strong zipper although it bows in places as zippered items sometimes do especially the more they re washed seems put together well although the fabric is a little rough feeling bought mainly for the grandkids to play wear so acceptable for that,boy's clothing,0

huggies new leaf runs small 4 5t is more like a 3t leak love very soft and comfy better than regular pull ups much softer mom of 5 boys a new favorite soft and comfortable with no leaks would recommend pretty good eco friendly best new product for my little guy,i love the new huggies pull ups new leaf size 4t5t they fit me great no leaks they go up they go down and they work very well at night there a bit snug i just wished they had the cool alert system and i just wish huggies pull ups would make a size 5t6t that would be a very big help i have to wear huggies pull ups 24 7 due to health problems and i can t wear adult products because there way to big for me to wear i also wear huggies goodnights size s m can t wear the l xl there big on me and they leak i also wear the huggies training pant s size 4t5t boy s with cool alert and by learning i love the fact that you can put the velcro sides back together that s even a bigger help thank you huggies pull up s for such a great product please make a size 5t6t thank you so soft i use these at night for my toddler and he doesnt leak hes very long and lean and they fit him well these are extremely soft super comfy and thick made the right way they are designed just like the regular pull ups with the velcro straps on the sides so that you can take them off put them on without having to pull up or down and you can reapply them if you undid the sides and still want to use it it stretches where it needs to it is firm where it needs to be and the velcro is strong enough for my active crazy toddler boy who is running nonstop 24 7 he loves these they are extremely comfortable for him which is important to me they never ever leak either they are thick and absorb a lot i cant stand the pampers cruisers diapers because they are paper thin these are amazing i love how absorbent these diapers are my son is actually only when you re old but these work so much better than any nighttime diapers that i have tried i generally just use these at night to keep him from leaking through n love how soft and comfortable they are for him and the little designs are so cute i m not big into the mickey mouse theme so it s nice to have an alternative design my son really likes these olaf printed pull ups they are very comfortable huggies new leaf pull up are great my son has sensitive skin so he breaks out easily with these pulls he has not broke out yet my only complaint is everytime i pull them up my thumb goes through the sides and puts a whole in it one pull had no velcro so was useless nfound out while changing a child while on the go my son is 48lbs and 40 tall generally wears a 4 5t in normal pull ups size small in goodnites and underjams and these just barely fit him they are a struggle to get on and not rip them they held up ok overnight haven t had any leaks but he has woken up feeling wet on the outside of the pamper will not purchase again leak bug time and my 1yr d is not ready to start potty training g nyet super easy getting on but his pjs are soaked i usually use new leaf for my granddaughter but this batch two fell apart when i pull them up i will try one more time love everything about these very soft i am glad i tried them way more softer than regular huggies pull ups will be switching my son has has sensitive skin and this product was really comfortable for him it did not leave marks or scratches on the sides of his legs like other brands we have tried we are potty training so we use underwear while at home and pull ups at night and when out an about they hold up really well when he has an accident also i would definitely recommend this product this review was collected as part of a promotion i am currently potty training my third and final child and have tried multiple training pants and the pull ups new leaf brand has by far been the best they are the softest and least stiff pull up we have tried this review was collected as part of a promotion i honestly loved the package that they come in once you open it and pull one out they have a cute design and kids just get excited about putting it on they are super soft and easy to pull on the kids they are amazing and definitely great for potty training this review was collected as part of a promotion i liked the designs that the pull ups had they were very soft and comfortable to use my toddler had no problem pulling them up himself the only thing that i did not like was the sides when he had a poopy accident it was confusing to roll the pull up closed or i didn t do it right lol but overall these are nice this review was collected as part of a promotion the pull ups were soft and absorbent but i would not leave my toddler in these overnight there is a noticeable difference of absorbency between these and a diaper they fit just okay on my 30lb 2 5yr old he s pretty average all around and i find they come up pretty high in the front and back whereas easy ups do not and fit his frame better overall though if our normal brand was out of stock i wouldn t hesitate to purchase these instead also we had no skin issues while using them this review was collected as part of a promotion i love the way it fit and how flexible it was it literally feels like an underwear i couldn t even tell my child was not in underwear seemed mobile as my child moved around in them held up pretty good as the night went on great product and love how eco friendly it is this review was collected as part of a promotion pull ups new leaf training pants are amazingly soft they hugged my little guy wonderfully so effective yet gentle plus they are plant based natural which is a big deal in our household pull ups you have hit one out of the ballpark with this product love them this

of each sleeve to hold the zip in liner in place the zip in liner is also a reversible jacket with pockets for each direction i m very impressed with the quality of this jacket i love that i can take the inner fleece out and the jacket will still be warm enough but is safe for my daughter to wear in her car seat this is an absolutely gorgeous jacket we got the pink color it is great sturdy material warm and the extra layer insert is a great value i don t think anyone would be disappointed if they purchased this for their child warm fleece for the inside jacket the shell still has some insulation which was a happy to see the size was true to size overall very happy with this purchase i ve purchased these jackets before very good quality the only way to beat the price is if you can

thing ive purchased its never taken me this little or price wise to pick out clothes from my kidos i got this particular one which didnt disapoint for my 3 year old daughter and another set on here for my 8 year old and as well as a boy set for my 6 year old and its great not going to have to go pick out items the bundle came in its on individual boxes and kids loved that especially the little

that you can mix it up and make many different outfits with these my daughter is 4 i got her the 5t and the bottoms are a tad small on her so we are gonna get a bigger size bottoms to go with her tops it was so cute how it came packaged like it was from a boutique the outfits are super cute and i love that you can mix and match them my toddler loves all the outfits love the items although my little one is a little chunky so even though i brought a size up it still fit i wish i had brought 2 sizes up to give her a chance to get some more wear out of them she sure wont make it through the winter i will purchase again in a larger size though loved the outfits however im disappointed in the fact that i ordered a 2t set and one of the shirts was a 5t so ill be returning the whole package because of one shirt i spend way to long in the store trying to mix and match the outfits on my own so when i seen they had this box i got one and im happy i did i really loved the packaging great buy and i loved the packaging with a card enclosed showing all the possible combinations definitely recommend i bought this for my granddaughter and i am very pleased you can mix and match 4 outfits into 15

my daughter i got the 4t the pants is a tad big but i tucked it under and she is good she loves it these are supper cute i would have given 5 stars if the sweat pants were actual sweat pants not just thin cotton but they will do for a mild day note i honestly think the pink ponte style pants are the thickest i was honestly not expecting it to be great nit came in a cute box with tissue paper inside was a card that showed how they all could be interchanged this is going to be a birthday gift and i would definitely order it again i love this whole shipment right size perfect colors and well

honest rating a review i received 1pair of wonder nation girls plus school uniform stretch twill skinny pants in black they are well made with just the right amount of stretch in thighs they also have an elastic tightening option inside the waist i am happy with the quality of this product and rate it 5 out of 5 these pants are very well made good sturdy twill material that is slightly stretchy they are little heavier weight so they will really be good for fall and winter length is good the edge sits just at the ankle the color i received is navy blue and is true to color they wash dry and wear well with little to no wrinkles my niece says they are comfortable to wear and they look and feel true to size zipper and button style with a flat front and pockets looks nice not only for school

the waist since she is small waisted i received the wonder nation girls school uniform stretch twill skinny pants for free in exchange for my honest opinion as part of the walmart spark review program these pants are a nice deep navy color they fit like a glove they are not as soft as they look the waist is rather tight and the stretch is minimal love these great quality for the price well made sizing accurate these are great stretchy and versatile for my little gymnast she loves to be able to love easily and they are i can t recommend these enough they re not too clingy due to being skinny in the wrong places definitely school or church appropriate my daughter loves the pants the material is super soft and comfortable and the adjustable waist pants made the fit perfect for my daughter with her being inbetween sizes in pants the ankle openings are perfect size if they wish to cuff the pants or leave them uncuff they fit pretty true to size and great durable material but still conformable for all day wear the blue color did not fade after muitlple washes the wonder nation girls uniform stretch twill skinny pants are so cute i got the black pair they are great for the kids they are stretchy and comfortable so its great for all the activities kids have while they still look stylish and presentable my kids are very rough and this pants do a great job keeping their formal appearance i would suggest these for anyone who has kids in uniform last school year 2018 2019 in the beginning of the school year i bought about 5 pair of khaki pants size 10 from the uniform stores in our area and they did not last more than a few months 1 they fit snug in the butt area from the start 2 they only sold skinny pants 3 once washed they shrunk and fit even tighter 4 they got holes in the knees with ease i then decided to go on a search for some new pants i found these and live them and wanted to leave a great review and love that these meet the needs of my active child because of what i read about these pants online i was very eager to give them a try i love them they fit perfect and had lots of room to grow it just let me know that the other brand pants clearly were not made with good fabric or to last these were a tad long but my daughter is tall and growing taller by the minute and so i just had to fold the legs up a bit and it worked perfectly for her 1 they do not fit snug in the butt area from the start they are roomy 2 they are not skinny but instead boot cut pants 3 once washed they kept their true size over and over and over no shrinking occurred 4 they never got holes in the knees even though my daughter played just as hard in this brand and pair of pants as she did in the earlier pants purchased i am very pleased with this product my daughter loves these wonder nation girls uniform pants they look and fit great they are made from stretchy material so they fit better than other twill pants also they are machine washable and didn t shrink my daughter is on the thin side so the skinny pants weren t too big with a little bit of ironing the pants look great overall a wonderful pair of uniform pants that is perfect for girls these are wonder nation girls plus stretch trill skinny pants they wash well and come out of the dryer wrinkle free they are made well with a nice strong seams the color matches most uniform requirements yet they are stylish with the skinny jean pattern these will be a hit for school and everyday casual wear durable color fast great stitching to prevent tears they are easy to care for wash dry either fold or hang to keep shape like new has an adjustable waist band actual pockets on both front back functional belt loops great buy for any student needing a uniform for their kid you can iron them on low if you need to made of 97 cotton 3 spandex so they re breathable have a little stretch to them these are really nicely made they just have zero stretch i mean zero they re cute and structured but not easy to play in because of the lack of stretch kids need clothing that s easy to get around on the playground in,girl's clothing,1

years old and is 4 8 and 70lbs it hard to find stuff that fit her lengthwise that she can wear to school this skirt did have to be tightened all the way in for her but the length was perfect i felt confident in her wearing it to school will be purchasing another one girls school uniform pleated belted scooter is a stylish uniform for our local school the decorative belt front with a back elastic waistband makes it fast and easy to get ready for school day with no fuss the fit is great because the elastic band the polyester twill fabric is a little warm in the early school year but a blessing in the fall and winter the scooter part of this skirt makes it easy to stay covered while playing at recess or pe class this is a great addition to the child s outfits for school it mixes and matches with the shirts with ease the girls plus school uniform pleated belted scooter is well made and is true to the size and came in the color of khaki it does have sewn in biker shorts elastic waistband in the back and has belt with loops in the front making for a snug fit it is made of polyester twill fabric and the best part it is both wrinkle and fade resistant which makes it easy to wash and pop in and out of the dryer and ready to go the length of the skirt came down below her knees and she says it is soft on her skin in my included pictures we took it out of the package and tried it on before washing and drying so it does show wrinkles but once washed and dried the wrinkles were gone we will be purchasing a few more of these i give 2 thumbs up to girls plus school uniform these pleated scooters were fantastic quality they are well made durable and super soft which was very surprising in a skirt my daughter raved about how comfortable they were however they were a little bit big my daughter has a very slim petite figure so while the skirt was way too big around the waist it was the perfect length what this means is that by the time the skirt fits her in the waist it may be too short as i don t let her wear anything too high above the knees the best part about the material though besides being quite comfortable is there really isn t any need to iron the pleats fell back into place ok and there were no major wrinkles it s only been through the wash twice but so far so good on the color holding my little one is not too particularly rough though when she plays so it may not be quite as easy to care for on a more active child it is a uniform skirt but it is pretty cute and looks good with a colorful tee with sneakers as well you could even dress it up with some tights a nice blouse and a pair of mary jane heels this is a good quality skirt that holds up in the washer and the dryer and it doesnt fade the color my daughter loves wearing this it is very comfortable for her to wear in the classrooms the girls school uniform pleated belted scooter is adorable it s made with quality material and it s stylish i love the fact that the girls school uniform pleated belted scooter has a sewn in biker short so your little girl can feel comfortable when moving around it s also an added protection for her bottom she can run around without feeling insecure or worrying about her skirt flying up i think this girls school uniform pleated belted scooter is beautiful and appropriate for school i would recommend the girls school uniform pleated belted scooter for any school girl these are such a lifesaver so easy and convenient for the little ones to put on without the zipper or button the length is totally appropiate elementary school student girls school uniform pleated belted scooter was selected through the wal mart spark program in exchange for my honest opinion this is one cute little scooter for a little girl if your child has to wear uniforms this is the perfect uniform bottom it can either be worn for uniform purpose or it can be worn as a skirt for church or you can dress it up or down this scooter can also be used as an everyday bottom very cute with a button down or a polo shirt my daughter put this scooter on with easy and she said it was very comfortable she loves wearing it to school this is her go to the scooter she loves the girly girl look and skirts are her thing but she needs shorts so this works perfectly for her school uniform she either wears flats or tennis shoes with her uniform top depends on if she is going to the gym that day or not but she rather wear the flats yes i highly recommend this scooter for all little girls that still want the girlie girl look while attending school and having to wear uniforms the pleats and the belted scooter seals the deal perfect elementary school uniform fit as expected and shipped fast fits as expected and shipped fast i loved everything about this it looks really cute on my daughter love the skirt no ironing the girls school uniform pleated belted scooter is too cute the scooter is made of 100 polyester and has a surprise built in short for coverage i washed it immediately out of the packaging so my niece could wear it the pleats weren t a prominent as prior to washing but i used my steamer and got the clean lines back the skirt is true to size and is twirlable without exposing undergarments my niece couldn t wait to wear it her only suggestion was it would be great if it skort had pockets i recommend this line of school uniforms based on price and selection of garments if you need school uniforms that don t break the bank try this line sold at walmart very fast shipping great product great price great seller nthank you serves its purpose good quality fabric liked the material when it first arrived very soft and comfy inner shorts are dri fit simply good very disappointed after first wash itself piling up already i want to return it i love this pleated belted school uniform scooter skort it is very classy and perfect for back to school our school doesn t require school uniforms but i try to get clothing that is good for school and looks nice as well as is functional for my actively playing kids i got this in a size 8 and it fits true to size it also has an elastic waist and is a more stretchy material it is very soft but is wrinkle resistant which is nice because my daughter doesn t always put away her clothes neatly she can pair this with her polo shirts and have a classy uniform look or a dressier shirt and look really nice and pretty it s very comfortable too it has shorts sewn into it so when she forgets to keep her legs crossed she won t be showing off her underwear which is great because she does forget sometimes that she needs to keep her legs crossed or not do cartwheels but now she won t have to worry i really just love the look and design of this skort the belt makes it look fashionable the pleats gives her a more sophisticated look and she loves it too i did get to try this for free through the spark review program but the experience and opinions are my own,girl's clothing,1

pants have 4 nice size pockets for trinkets and here comes my favorite part the manufacturer reinforced the knee areas how nice my kids don t have uniforms at school but i m a customer for these pants and other products anyway my daughter is going into the 7th grade and wears uniforms to her school compared to other brands these have so many great qualities the fabric is soft and breathable not thick and stiff like other uniform brands the soft fabric also makes it easier to roll a cuff at the bottom if they re too long my daughter loved that the waist was stretchy instead of having a button and zipper she s tall for her age and these were a good length giving her some room to grow she typically wears a 14 16 or xl in girls clothes overall great fit and quality i am doing a review on wonder nation girls school uniform pants it states they are twill i have never heard of that before so i had to look it up to understand what kind of fabric we are talking about the twill fabric has a diagonal weave which makes it stretchy and comfortable i looked at the tag and it says it is made of 97 cotton and 3 spandex that is the reason these pants are so comfortable you have the comforts from the twill fabric and the cotton fabric they are also very stretchy you get that from the twill fabric and the spandex fabric they used the right fabric in order to make these pull on pants the twill and spandex work great for pulling these pants up and down to get them on and off with ease in front of the pants it looks like it has a zipper but it doesn t it has a wide waistband with elastic in it for pulling them up and down with ease also the waistband is made very thick i think it will last a long time these pants seem to be made very well the pants have two side pockets that have ample room inside there are also two pockets in the back the pants that i received are black and very pretty and stylish they can be worn at school or any social gathering my granddaughter has a party coming up and she will be wearing these pants to it they look very nice they do not look cheap or cheaply made they look very fashionable she was very pleased with them the size that i have is an 8 and they seem to be true to size this is the same size that she wears in other clothes i have not washed them yet so i do not know if they will shrink or not they also come in khaki and navy i highly recommend these pants these are great uniform pants the only thing i wish regarding the style is that the ankle was more skinny fit so the leg is not so wide at the ankle my daughter said the elastic waistband is comfortable and she really likes the pants they fit true to size just wide through the legs they are thicker material so they will hold up really well and stay warm in the winter i received sizes for each of my daughters and both had the issue with the ankle being too wide so it would be nice if they were more skinny fit to look more stylish other than that they are great pants i have bought a pair of pants for my oldest daughter in this brand before in a similar style these pants have the stretchy waistline instead of the button and adjustable hidden buttons i like both kinds that they put out now i did not see that these adjust any in the waist other than just simply stretching my oldest daughter is eight and a half and she has always been a little bit more of on the small side so we got her the size seven which is what she wears right now and last year too the pants were a great fit and just long enough there was room to grow tall and a little wider too they stayed up on her hips even though there was room in the back still for the butt to grow a little more it did not feel too long or too wide perfect fit for her and she likes them they are comfortable and move better than her other pair of pants that are from the same brand they washed well and i did not see any fade or tearing or any wear i am thinking they will hold up very nice for the school year and even though our school does not do uniforms i plan to buy some of these pants for both of my kids because they are so nice of pants and they feel soft and comfortable yet durable looking khakis i think they can flip hop run and jump in these just fine my kids have special needs and i got the thumbs up from my oldest daughter i hope my young one will love it to since she has so much sensory issues but i am guessing she will the color looks like a normal navy and i hope to find they offer these in all the normal colors you would typically find pants in like white khaki black etc school uniforms are life saving and at the same time a pain the good thing is that your kids don t have to stand in front of the closet every morning to choose what to wear to school the bad thing is that they constantly grow out of the uniforms and sometimes you have to buy new set during school year i like these wonder nation girls school uniform stretch twill pull on pants because they are super stretchy and easy to put on or take off the prints have four functional pockets and a reinforced knee for added durability these pants are equipped with a special stain release treatment so they will stay looking new even longer my daughter says they are very comfortable and don t press into the stomach too much when she sits at her desk i haven t tried washing them yet but hopefully they will last long as other wonder nation school pants we have i got these medium weight pull on pants with stretch waist band in beige for my daughters school uniform they were a little long for her in a size 10 but i will probably have them taken up because the pants themselves are very good quality it has a nice cotton stretch waist band and reinforced knees which she always tears out somehow overall very nice fabric is fine but fit runs huge so much bigger and longer than wonder nation girl uniform legging pants pictures tell it all both pants are of the same brand and the same size 16 but they look like mommy and child pair the pant legs are very baggy too thigh width 22 inseam 30 way too big and long for my 62 tall daughter despite the size chart recommendation the wonder nation girls plus school uniform stretch twill pull on pants are really nice they have reinforced knees which is nice the stitching seems perfectly done the khaki color is exactly what is required at my daughters school only issue is there s no belt loops so if your child s school is like mine it s required they wear a belt everyday without belts loops that s kind of impossible other than that i really like these pants they can be used for different occasions won t be wasted these pants were so much better than i expected they are not tight fitting they have a regular fit and no tight legs these are sewn well elastic waist band two front pockets stain release reinforced knee and they stretch they also have two back pockets these are 97 cotton 3 spandex these are machine washable dryer safe and low iron these pants are not lightweight i like these pants and recommend them for children my daughter is going into the 7th grade and wears uniforms to her school compared to other brands these have so many great qualities the fabric is soft and breathable not thick and stiff like other uniform brands the soft fabric also makes it easier to roll a cuff at the bottom if they re too long my daughter loved that the waist was stretchy instead of having a button and zipper she s tall for her age and these were a good length giving her some room to grow she typically wears a 14 16 or xl in girls clothes so they re a little baggy on her but overall we like them and they re good quality these pants are adorable they are softer than i expected which is a good thing they have a stretchy waistband which my daughter loves the color is great and even after a few washes they still look new the only drawback for me is the length my daughter is on the short side and these are too long for her so they ll have to be hemmed these are great uniform pants the only thing i wish regarding the style is that the ankle was more skinny fit so the leg is not so wide at the ankle my daughter said the elastic waistband is comfortable and she really likes the pants they fit true to size just wide through the legs they are thicker material so they will hold up really well and stay warm in the winter i have a little girl stating kinder this fall this is her first uniform pants she gets to wear i like the material and the fact that the knees are reinforced however my daughter is on the slim side if your kids are slim these pants will not fit perfectly the stretchy waist is a little too big for my daughter i will fix it myself so that it fits proper other than that the length of the pants legs is perfect true to size definitely the blue is very dark and i m really hoping it doesn t fade right away my daughter s love these pants when i asked them about the pants and how they fit and how they liked them they said that they love the pants and that they are very comfy they love the fact that the pants are stretchable in the waist but also that the band isn t tight on their waists they would love for other little kids to enjoy these pants as well my daughter s love these pants when i asked them about the pants and how they fit and how they liked them they said that they love the pants and that they are very comfy they love the fact that the pants are stretchable in the waist but also that the band isn t tight on their waists they would love for other little kids to enjoy these pants as well i got my package yesterday it was in good condition the fit of the pants is great and the material is stretchy to where it s comfy my daughter said she liked them and can t wait to use them for school i also like how it s fitted around the waist no belt needed soft stretchy material with plenty of pockets easy to bend and play with this type of material yet also heavy duty to tolerate wear and tear of a young girl wish this was the material and style for boys nice soft waistband for comfort yet stay in place color is very nice these fit well with a nice design and a great look i would love to see more clothing designed like these and in a multitude of colors,girl's clothing,0

1021,"Wonder Nation Girls School Uniform Bow Scooter Skirt, Sizes 4-16 & Plus",3.0,4.7,81.0,adorable and great quality pretty skirt super adorable nice and comfortable skirt nice school skirt school bigger than expected thick skirt with shorts decent scooter runs bigger recommended but buy smaller than normal size appropriate very comfortable runs big adorable but size is larger than normal looks cute and fits well love it my fav,first of all this uniform skirt is so adorable i want to scream when my daughter put it on i wanted to squeeze her so hard it is super high quality and it is very functional my daughter has already abused this skirt and it still looks amazing after several washes it is a navy blue and looks great with a variety of tops it has a short underlay its a scourt so she can play to her little hearts desire without showing too much it fits great and has an adjustable waistband she does attend a uniform school but it is so cute it could be worn anywhere my daughter loves it to because she knows how adorable she looks in it and it is comfortable for her to look pretty and play in i definitely recommend i love the detail on this skirt the bow on the front of the waist is nice and beautiful i love that it does not get undone because it is stitched to stay in place the silver circle accents give it a nice touch also i like that the material feels like silk a little the material is durable and will withstand many washes without fading or shrinking it is made of 100 percent polyester the best part is that it has shorts underneath it is the perfect skirt to wear to school any day of the week it gives school uniforms a whole new look that i love with that said i highly recommend this skirt and brand it s a great skirt fit my baby girl really well she doesn t go to a uniform school but it is super cute and it s soft minute we got it my girl wanted to wear it too bad she didn t want to sit still for the pic i would recommend this for any kid that like skirts it s good for church and school and straight play thinking about buying another one what can i say with this school uniform skirt made by wonder nation it is so adorable and fits well to my daughter xa0the school changed their uniform this year and this is a perfect skirt for her xa0so definitely i will be buying more school uniform this year in wonder nation brand the accent bow in front is nice touched and the pleated skirt has a back elastic waistband for natural pull on comfort my daughter will never have to worry about the zipper and button xa0the dress has sewn in short inside so the outfit from school learning time to playtime after school is no problem at all xa0i washed it with cold water and low heat dryer the fabric did not shrink did not fade the gray color and less wrinkled than i expected the durable polyester twill fabric made this skirt xa0now my daughter wants to use the same gray skirt or skort for anime costume birthday party as spark reviewer i suggest this skirt by wonder nation the school year will start in a month so start shopping your kid s uniform at walmart and look for wonder nation brand okay so i have a leggy six year old girl it just so happens that this year they do not have a set uniform to wear but for me it is so much easier to have a few basic mix and match bottoms and several more basic mix and match tops so this size 6 navy blue bow skirt with shorts underneath fits really well into her school wardrobe the length works so it is not too short to wear to school while still being a cute length for a child the shorts underneath are an absolute must for an active six year old i don t even buy skirts without shorts underneath unless she s going to wear tights with them and actually she can wear tights with this skirt in the winter time the skirt and shorts are 100 polyester so it s not breathable but keeps wrinkles away really well the waistband is about an inch and the front is very sturdy and flat with a center bow the back of the waistband is gathered and stretchy the three pleats in the front are really schoolgirl cute and allows for more movement during exercise time and outside play there are no pleats or pockets in the back which is fine my little one is tall and skinny 48lbs about 4 2 and the waist is a tiny bit big on her but i give it a few more months and it will be fitting fine the one thing that would put this skirt over the top is if it had front pockets this is a good quality skirt for school cute little belt design on the front with pleats i bought this fir my 9nyr old who s on the smaller size 4 ft 4 56lbs size 10 12 and it was too big for her as there isn t any way to tighten the skirt this did fit my 12 4 ft 11 5 62lbs year old who usually wears 14 16 as she s long legged he came down to her knees and didn t need to be tightened i have a 6 5 year old daughter that would wear skirts and dresses everyday if i let her unfortunately with her growing up with brothers she doesn t usually sit properly which is a concern of mine once she started school i generally would make her wear pants shorts to school despite her begging to wear skirts dresses one the days i do give in to let her wear a dress skirt i would always make her wear a pair of cotton shorts underneath i could not wait for her to give these a try because they have the shorts already built into the skirt i chose to get the skirt in a size 7 because she generally wears clothing between a size 6 to a size 8 depending on the brand etc this particular brand seems to run a little on the bigger side but i m sure within in the next month she will fit it perfectly just in time for school to start it is mostly only big in the waist portion but i feel like once it gets washed a time or two it will provide a better fit for her i love the dark black color this skirt has and the bow is a huge winning point for my daughter another thing to take note of is the length of this skirt i was expecting a skirt that would be about mid thigh area whereas this one comes completely down to her knees the material this skirt is made out of seems like it is not only comfortable for her to wear but that it is also durable enough to last for many years to come overall i am completely satisfied with this skirt the color looks amazing the bow makes it unique and i feel like it will last her for a few years until she outgrows it i would recommend this skirt to anyone with a child headed back to school i feel like it can be worn for any school setting and would go perfectly with any shirt this skirt is made in vietnam the skirt and shorts are made from 100 polyester the skirt is fairy thick and not see thru at all the front has pleats and the back is smooth the waist is very stretchy elastic the front design is so adorable with the metal rings and a ribbon bow the bow is sewn on and cannot be adjusted the skirt underneath is thin i would suggest having the child wear neutral under garments so that you cannot see a print but otherwise is great your child can do cartwheels and all the running they want without showing anything they shouldn t the skirt seems pretty true to size my child just had a growth spurt and her waist is a tad thinner right now so the skirt fits but is a little big in the waist this will probably fit her perfect in the fall this skirt has the approval from my child i would love if it were in cotton rather than polyester but beautiful skirt this is a cute scooter it s durable easy care comfortable the material has a nice soft feel to it the elastic waistband is great for my granddaughter i also love the built in shorts since my granddaughter is very active at school the size was a true fit even after washing and drying it fit great and comfy the scooter can also be worn outside of school with a cute shirt the only complaint i have is i wish it was about an inch longer but other than that this is an awesome scooter that s prices right my 6 5 year old daughter absolutely loves wearing skirts dresses to school unfortunately she doesn t sit properly while wearing them unless i m there to constantly remind her for this reason i generally make her wear a pair of shorts under her skirts and dresses with school starting back in about a month i know she is going to want to wear skirts to school this cute skirt comes with the shorts already built in so therefore i feel more inclined to let her wear these to school i think this skirt would be perfect for any school type setting i chose to get the skirt in a size 7 since my daughter wears clothes in a size 6 up to a size 8 depending on the brand i will say this skirt runs a bit on the larger side the waist is currently a bit lose on her but i m sure she will quickly grow into it possibly before school even starts the cute bow really brings this skirt together and i feel like it will last her through the school year with no issues i also like how well this color can be matched with about any shirt overall i am satisfied with this skirt and i feel like it would be a great addition to any wardrobe for school age children this skirt was a long awaited surprise for my daughter she loves skirts but i have been hesitant to let her wear one to school as she isn t good with sitting properly but this skirt unlike many others i have bought has sewn in biking shorts it also has a really cute bow on the top which was absolutely adorable and i knew my daughter would love it however when she tried this skirt on it was way too big she is a size 5 in other children s clothes but this size 5 was a lot larger than normal she was very disappointed but i promised to hold on to them so she can wear it when she gets bigger the beige color would into what is acceptable for most school uniforms and the length is appropriate if you are ordering this skirt online check for a sizing chart to make sure you are ordering the appropriate size if you are planning to purchase in store get the child to try on the item before buying it is a beautiful skirt but the size is definitely an issue if you are hoping to use this product sooner rather than later i received the wonder nation girls plus school uniform bow scooter and am very happy with it it fit a little big but it gives her room to grow for the school year so as long as the skort can make it through the wash she should be able to wear it all school year i do reccomend taking it out of the dryer immediately so you will not have to iron it it dries quite nicely but if left in the pile of clothes too long it will need to be ironed as it will be full of wrinkles this is a great scooter skirt very stylish and my child really enjoyed it we do not have to use uniforms but she already has planned a outfit for back to school with this skirt i like the built in shorts to keep my childs modesty while still being able to be a kid overall great qualit great skirt my daughter wears a size 12 and this skirt is a size 12 and it was slighly big this skirt was a long awaited surprise for my daughter she loves skirts but i have been hesitant to let her wear one to school as she isn t good with sitting properly but this skirt unlike many others i have bought has sewn in biking shorts it also has a really cute bow on the top which was absolutely adorable and i knew my daughter would love it however when she tried this skirt on it was way too big she is a size 5 in other children s clothes but this size 5 was a lot larger than normal she was very disappointed but i promised to hold on to them so she can wear it when she

ordering the appropriate size if you are planning to purchase in store get the child to try on the item before buying it is a beautiful skirt but the size is definitely an issue if you are hoping to use this product sooner rather than later my daughter loves the fit and color of this skirt she can wear it with almost any shirt it looks great for any occasion the fit really does look great it washes well but most importantly is that my daughter likes it i absolutely love this skirt it has built in little stretchy shorts i love that because it protects the modesty of the little girl wearing it it comes pre pleated it didnt shrink much in the laundry the color did not fade after the first wash love these so much the ease of your little one putting them on without your help amazing you don t have to worry about them using a button or zipper the length is also appropiate out of all of uniform bottoms wonder nation is the best good fit and perfect for school uniforms very well made has biker shorts underneath but they are short and tends to bunch up otherwise a great beautiful buy for uniforms,girl's clothing,1
