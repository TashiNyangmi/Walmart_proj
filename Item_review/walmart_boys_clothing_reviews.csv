They have an always useful adjustable waist, tag-free, four pockets and they are made with stretch fabric for added comfort. My son said they are comfortable, as a mom I can say that I am happy about the quality. They look good, feel good and they have a great price!', 'I received the School Uniform Flat Front Shorts in a charcoal grey color. These shorts could be used for school uniforms but they would also be good for a dressier occasion or church. The shorts are a very nice deep charcoal color that is a neutral that would go with anything. They are a great nice quality fabric that is also very soft. My favorite feature on these shorts is the adjustable waist! You used to only see the button adjustable waist on the higher end children stores, but not anymore! You simply adjust the button inside the waist band and you are able to accommodate several sizes! My child is on the thinner side, so this is perfect for helping the pants fit. I will also note that these shorts are a great softness and wash great! They were wrinkle free even after sitting in the dryer for awhile. The top has a tab closure to make it easier for little fingers. I think a button is too hard at that age so perfect addition. The fabric on these is non- wrinkle and such a great quality. Do not feel thin at all, but great for every day wear.', 'These Bermuda shorts are thick and well made. I can tell they will handle many machine washes. They have four pockets and come with an adjustable waist elastic belt in the inside. I like that Wonder Nation offers all sizes, even for husky kids. These shorts come in khaki, navy and black.

I got black, and I just threw them in the wash, you need some kind of static cling stuff, because everything and it's mother will stick these shorts, just fyi. other than that the shorts are soft and flexible, but thick enough to hold up after weekly use."", ""This review is for the Wonder Nation Slim Boys School Uniform Super Soft Flat Front Shorts. First off they weren't kidding when they say these are slim boys. My son is 9 and he is only 2 lbs above being considered underweight so he is pretty slim and these shorts didn't fit him! He had to suck in as much as he could just to button them and I got the size 10 so they should have definitely fit him. So I would say they run very small. I guess I should have gotten a size 12. It was disappointing too because I was hoping to use these along with a cute shirt I got him for his school picture day tomorrow but I had to search for a different option for shorts. If they did fit him I would probably recommend but being as he was really not able to use them there isn't much to go by in terms of how good they are or how comfortable. They seem to be a good material thought and not thin. They do adjust but that does not do anything helpful if they are already to small, that only is beneficial if they start out being to big. The size issue has nothing to do with the quality though as like I said that seems to be up to par and for that reason I would recommend as not everyone will have the same issue we did. Just be aware that you may need to order a size up."", 'These shorts are great!  I love the adjustable waist.  They wash great and wear great.  My son has a dress code at school and these are perfect.  Highly recommend.', 'Size runs extremely small!!!  My child has been wearing a size 8 shorts by the SAME brand name for the past year, so I ordered a size up to a size 10. I ordered the slim size thinking that it would just be smaller maybe in the thighs but not in the waist. When I got them, I cut the tags off and washed them thinking they were OK and tried them on my child only to find out that they were incredibly small. The button to the buttonhole was probably a good inch apart. And that was with the side extenders on the waist all the way out.  Now i am out $50.  Beware of the sizing', 'Excellent shorts.

My kid loves that they are thick, but not stiff. The color is perfect for camouflaging light stains and dirt. The hidden elastic belt allows it to be shrunk to her waist. Because her waist is so small, it creates ruffles and makes it look puffy, which she likes. My favorite part about the elastic belt is that the ends are sewn into the pant so there’s no risk of losing them when pulling too hard. It is also a bit on the long side, but she just tucks in the seam and she’s good to go. I know this pair of pants is for boys, which would explain why they’re too wide and too long. My girls have been raised with boy clothes because they are more durable than the equivalent in girls. Considering that my girls act like boys and like climbing trees, sliding on the grass, jumping fences, etc, boys’ pants last them much longer than girls’ pants. Plus, I usually get clothes that allow room for them to grow to cut down on our clothes budget. These pants are great for our needs.', 'We have a very short son who wears a size 4. These are really long on him. We had them hemmed up by a friend and they fit perfect. Too long is a very easy fix and can be taken out when he grows. These pants are perfect for little boys. They have stain release, wrinkle free and reinforced knees, for those little men who are overly active. We love these pants! They have not lost there color from washing. I highly recommend these for your sons school uniform to last all year long!', 'Wonder Nation Boys School Uniform Flat Front Pants holds up to its name. It is definitely very soft. It is made of 98% Cotton and 2% Spandex. Not only the pants is soft, but there is a dual layer material around the knee area. The material used inside of the knee is even softer than the rest of the pants. This is perfect because kids pants tend to wear and tear around the knee area often, this dual layer will definitely protect the boy’s knees. I have posted a photo showing the inside of the pants where the dual layer cloth is located. It doesn’t look very nice inside, but I guess it doesn’t really matter because no one will see the inside. Great design! Wonder Nation Boys School Uniform Flat Front Pants do not wrinkle easily and uses super soft cotton-spandex stretch twill. Another great feature I really like about these pants is the adjustable elastic waistband. Kids grow fast, if you buy a little bigger sized pants and the waist do not fit, you can always tighten the waist line if necessary. I have washed these pants several times already and the color have not faded at all. These pants are soft, comfortable and durable. The Wonder Nation Boys School Uniform Flat Front Pants has a great design and are made of very nice materials. Lastly, they look absolutely great!', 'The Wonder Nation uniform pants for boys are really nice. It has a flat front, which is easier to iron and a more modern fashion look. I usually like to purchase the pants a little bigger than what my son usually wears, so they can fit all school year. These pants are perfect to use for two sizes, since they have adjustable elastic waistbands that can be tighten or loosen to grow with your child’s waist. The fit is not too baggy as it comes in a straight cut. The knees are reinforced with a think fabric in the inside, making them harder to rip. My son always seems to “eat” through pants as they rip from the knees very fast, but with reinforced knees the pants last longer. The fabric has a little stretch in it since it is 98% cotton and 2% spandex. The material is strong and thick, but they are not a hot material. I feel like the stretch will also help them last longer and not get ripped easily as well as allowing my son to move more comfortably through his day at school. They are wrinkle resistant, they still get a little wrinkled but not it isn’t as noticeable as other wrinkled material. I have attached a picture of the elastic waistband and reinforced knees.', 'I received these boys wonder nation school uniform soft flat front pant for my daughter to wear at school that requires her to wear uniforms. Immediately I knew these were good quality school pants by the fabric. The fabric is soft but thick and structured well. My daughter wears uniforms to school and these are a great quality and fit her nicely. She wears a size 6 in girls pants and these are a size 5 in boys which she fits perfectly sometimes the size 6 uniform pants are on the looser side. There is an inside stretch band to tighten the waistband. These pants have a reinforced knee which is fantastic! And they have stain release technology and they are also wrinkle resistant! I do not iron so this is major deal for this mom! The price is decent as well. I have paid much more for other band uniforms only to have them stained and worn out quickly and for this price with all these extras, the price is fabulous! I would absolutely recommend these uniforms!', 'I really like these soft khaki boy uniform pants. They are made of 98% cotton and 25% spandex. You machine wash the pants in cold water and tumble dry low. They hold up well in the wash. I received size 8. They fit true to size and are roomy enough to bend and stretch in. The knees have soft patches on them to reinforce them. It has slit pockets on the front and back. The pants have an adjustable waist. They come in four different colors. They have a great price.', ""My son is six years old and has a tall, slender build. Because of his height, he needs a size seven or eight for length. Most pants come with the adjustable waist to make the larger size work for him. When I ordered these, I ordered a size seven to give him the length he needed. Surprisingly, they were a little longer than normal. We actually had to roll them up twice for him to wear them. But, the waist runs very small. He almost can't latch them closed. They do have the adjustable waist. However, we have no need to use it with the size being smaller than usual. He says they fit fine and do not bother him. So, as long as he feels comfortable, he can wear them."", ""Never fear, there are really good qualities about these pants. The quality of the fabric and make of the pants is very good. After several washes, they still look and feel as good as new. I actually like them better than some of his other, more expensive uniform pants. Other brands tend to be made of a heavier fabric, which is no good here in Florida and they can feel stiff. He definitely likes that they aren't like that."", 'Bottom line, the pants are a great price and value. But, when you purchase, be sure to order a size larger than normal.', 'Overall, I was pretty happy with these Wonder Nation boys’ school uniform pants! I was very surprised at how great the quality of the pants seems to be, and how soft they were. They also feel very durable but the softness of the material doesn’t make them feel stiff. They have a really nice stretch to them, and I think they’re going to really hold up over time. I love that there’s a stain release treatment, so hopefully that will keep them stain free throughout the many wears. The reinforced knee patch is a great feature – especially for boys – and doesn’t seem to bother my son at all like other similar products do. I love that they are wrinkle resistant so I don’t need to iron them. The adjustable elastic waistband is an absolute must for my children so this is a vital feature for me. The color is a nice dark navy, which I’m hoping doesn’t fade over time. The only complaint that I have is that when I washed them, the pants attracted fuzz from the other clothes – which is not something that happens with the other uniform pants we own. Overall, I would highly recommend these uniform pants to anyone that needs good quality, affordable school clothes.', 'I like these pants, the material and cut are comfortable for the kiddos. But the material attracts lint, an issue we\'ve encountered with all ""dressy"" pants we\'ve tried to purchase from walmart. If it wasn\'t for that (major) factor, we would give 5 stars. Easy care, easy wear.', 'The wonder nation boys khakis run big in my opinion. The waist is adjustable however the pants were still too big everywhere else on my little one. I ordered his usual size in other brands. The pants do wash and dry nicely without wrinkles. If you hang them up right out of the dryer no ironing is needed. They are 98% cotton and 2% spandex. The material appears to be good quality. Unfortunately my little one will have to grow some more before he can wear these. The button closure is a metal clasp on the inside. It is easy to open and close. They have side pockets and back pockets. Overall the pants are nice but I definitely recommend you consider sizing down.', ""These pants are made in Dominican Republic. The washing instructions are to machine wash with like colors and tumble dry low. You may use an iron on the lowest setting if needed, but I find if I take out of the dryer right away, I don't need to iron. There is no instructions for the washing temperature. I received a size 5 as my son is in between a 5 and 6 for length. Plus I had something else from Wonder Nation that ran a tad big. These fit my son perfect! He has a little room to grow in them, but they do not drag on the floor."", '', ""There are a few things about these pants that I think make for an amazing pair of pants. The first is I love that these pants have reinforced knees. My son is very active (as I assume all boys are) and the knees are the first to go in pants. So, pants with added knee supports is always a bonus! The second is my son is skinny. Like super skinny so getting pants that fit him in length usually are so big in the waist they fall off of him. These have the adjustable waist, So I don't have to worry about them falling down. The third is these are made with 98% cotton and 2% spandex. I am not a fan of polyester myself, and think cotton breathes so much better. These pants are soft and I am told comfortable. Perfect pants for school, or semi dressy occasions."", 'These pants are advertised as being boys’ pants but I’ve had my daughter wear them and they looked super cute on her. I would say these pants could easily be unisex. They are flat front and the legs flow straight down. That means they don’t have a shaped leg like boot cut or skinny, etc. They are reinforced in the knee but not in a bulky, awkward way. They are a crisp tan/khaki and stay true to their color even after washing. Appropriate sized pockets for children’s hands and adjustable inner waist band. The adjustable inner waist makes it a huge help when it comes to my child not having to wear a belt.', 'They washed easy and didn’t shrink. They also didn’t require ironing. A quick “wack” out of the dryer and then folded makes these pants look neat and straight. Of course, iron them if you’re looking for a sharp-edged crease, but word of caution on that: “iron on lowest setting, if needed” reads the instructions on the inside of the pants. They are made of mostly cotton and with only 2% spandex. The tag on the pants says they are stain release and wrinkle resistant. These pants would make a nice addition to any child’s school wardrobe, uniform or not.', 'The Wonder Nation Boys School Uniform Pants look very sturdy. They are navy blue and are size five with 25 inches in length. The waist is adjustable which is good when you need a bigger or smaller waist. There are four pockets in total two in the front and two in back. There is a snap slip button and zipper. There is a reinforced knee and belt loops round out the pants.', 'I received the Wonder Nation brand boy’s school uniform in straight fit, navy blue, in a size 4. It is solidly constructed and looks stylish, while still being comfortable and durable. Some details that I love about this pant is that there are four large pockets, two in back and two on the side. There is also an invisible elastic in the waist with adjustable button holes so that you can take in the waist band a bit if you child is smaller, and the item can grow with your child as needed. The front button on the pant is decorative and instead there is a metal clasp to hold the pant in place along with the zipper. For older kids this is not a big deal, but for younger children especially those that are just learning to potty train this is perfect because a simple clasp is so much easier for them to do themselves and really gives a sense of independence to the child. I also like how the item is tagless. Wash instructions are printed right onto the inside of the pant so there are no itchy tags to bother your child. I love thoughtful design and I greatly appreciate these small details in clothing. The pants are 98% cotton and 2% spandex, and can be machine washed and dried on low.', 'When the Wonder Nation Boys School Uniform Super Soft Flat Front Pants arrived I was happy to see they are made with almost all cotton and a bit of spandex for flexible comfort while playing. I was impressed by how well they are made and the softness of the fabric. They have strong belt loops, slit pockets on front and back, and the waist adjustment tab on the inside. The waist adjuster is unlike others I have had in kids pants before. It is actually sewn on both sides so you can tighten the waist to the desired button but it you prefer no button adjustment the elastic stays in place. Instead of getting pulled into the slit never to be found again. I picked a size eight since generally my son is wearing an 8 but slightly into 10. They were a bit too small for him in the waist and length. I definity should have went with the size ten. My son really liked the feel and comfort of the pants though and I’m guessing the ten will work perfect. I paired the pants with the Wonder Nation dress shirt as can be seen in the photos. I received a nice full catalog in the package that shows all the colors and sizes of all their school clothes. I was impressed how inexpensive the shirt and pants are! They feel and look like much more costly school uniforms.', 'They are soft and they don’t seem to wrinkle as bad with the material. I would recommend!
