I have had a million pairs in the black and different color denim and LOVED them. I would just replace them periodically because my thighs would rub holes and for the price, that was fine for me. They were not see through, held everhthing in, and were comfortable. Throughout quarantine, I put on some weight. I ran to Walmart to buy these but could only find one pair in the next size, so i immediately hopped on here and ordered three pairs. The ones I purchased in store fit perfectly and were exactly the same as the old pairs. The ones I got online‚Äîthe new version are HORRIBLE!!! The material is wack. They are less stretchy to begin with and as the day goes on they loosen up horribly. I was horrified to go to the bathroom in the late afternoon and discover they had stretched out so far in the front that it looked like I had a bulge. So I tried to pull them up and instead ended up with a front wedgie. Either way, super unflattering and embarassing. I had to go home on my lunch break and squeeze into my too tight ones, and even then, those looked better. Guess I will have to find a new go to pant unless they change it back. Ugh. Walmart FAIL!

Will order XXL and hope they fit!!', 'Very upset. The first pair of black jeggings I had were very soft and fit perfect. I ordered 2 more and they are a different/stiffer material and they are way too small. I would give 0 stars. Must return. By the way, these are all made in different countries if you read the inside tags, and the fabric content varies. Why, if these are all Time and Tru?', 'I got 3 pairs of these. Medium denim and black soot came in the mail today. I ordered a size S, which is a 4/6, but it\'s DEFINITELY more like a solid 6. I\'m a solid 4, and they are very big in the waist. The legs are a bit loose as well, but not too terribly. I just exchanged for an XS, which is crazy, because I am *not* that small. But I\'m hoping that the fit will be better. \n\nQuality wise, they seem very great. Stretchy enough to be comfy, thick enough to not easily tear or be see through. I love the faux button - it makes it possible to actually front tuck without looking like you have on fake jeans ;-)\n\nThe rise is HIGH. 12"" according to my measure. I\'m over 5\'7"" and it works for me, but may be hard for short torso peeps to handle.  They are a little shorter than I prefer, ankle-ish length. But for under $13, as long as the XS fit without having to constantly adjust them, I\'ll wear the heck outta them this winter!\n\nI will say the black ones run smaller than the medium denim. By at least an inch or more in the waist. I almost thought I should keep them, but decided I\'d still prefer a snugger fit. BUT, if you\'re more of a 6 exactly, you MIGHT want to size up on the black soot. (For whatever reason black denim...and apparently even jeggings...always runs much smaller! Weird. If anyone knows the secret why, share?)', 'These are NOT the same Time and Tru jeggings sold in November 2019. I bought 4 pairs last year and absolutely loved them so i was restocking for this year  Just like jeans but with the stretch of a legging. These new ones however was extremly disspointed with and returned them all yesterday. They are pull on pants with the fake zipper button and pockets in front. Idk why they changed them I like the feel of wearing jeans that you zip and button and can put your hands in a pocket.

Please go back to a real jean look with a legging feel Thank you!', ""I have several pair of these, I like them, but, these are slightly different than the ones previously purchased, they changed the waist, and now there is a large gap at the back of the waist band, they were perfect before, always remember don't fix it if, It aint broken!

It stated 58% cotton, 39% modal (a type of rayon made from the fibers of the beech tree) and3% spandex. It looks nice but the collar area reminds me of a t-shirt type collar in style. It has 3 gold buttons attached to one shoulder. It also comes with an extra button. I got an x-small and it was a bit small in the shoulder but not so much that I wouldn't wear it so I asked my neighbor to try it and it was too large on her. It was also large around the waist and hung low. We are both very short also. I am a small person as is my neighbor so neither of us was 100% happy with the fit.

I like the material on this shirt and it is definitely a small, like it is supposed to be, but it is more of a small petite I would say because it is shorter than just a regular small would be.

I wear sports bras often and in this heat it gets Mighty hot because they get squished together so I have to put a lot of baby powder there but with this bra I don't have to put so much baby powder to keep dry because this bra still separates.

Medium weight denim, not too warm, not too hot. only downside is they still have that halfworn look about them, not a deep dark finish like pictured.', ""I've always really liked the straight leg classic fit Riders by Lee, and have worn them for years, size 6M. But, my big complaint with my recent purchase is regarding the inseam length. The classic fit straight leg Riders I purchased maybe 4-5 years ago finally wore out, and I needed to buy new ones, so I ordered them (3 pairs), not being able to find them in a store anywhere. I was extremely disappointed to find that this supposedly exact same jean and exact same size is now a solid inch shorter in the inseam than the ones I bought a few years back. Plus, the cotton content is now higher (81%) than the older ones (74%), so when washed, that inch shorter became more than an inch. (I'm 62, and not exactly getting taller; just the opposite.) I can't wear them with any kind of heel, and they're almost too short for even a flat shoe. I really like this jean...but why in the world was the inseam changed?! I think a 6L will be too long. Thus my 3-star rating. Very disappointed."", 'I was disappointed in this pair of jeans. The last pair I bought - and the photo on the website - were solid dark blue. I had been looking everywhere for a pair that were not pre-faded, as I would like them to look nice for a while before they become gardening jeans. I was excited to find them on the website, thinking I had found the original basic jeans without the ""fashion-fading."" These arrived with a VERY distinctive and unflattering faded pattern that makes it look as though the crotch area is actually wet, because it is sooo much darker than the thighs. I really wish Lee would still offer one-color jeans!', 'I have several pairs of these jeans as I like them really well sooo I ordered more and the 2 pair I got seemed like they ride lower on the hips and I am always pulling them up...I dont care for that', 'Purchased on reviews of so many.

I think they are actually 16L!"", 'These say there the same pant but they are a little longer than the last ones I ordered, and taller at waist as well.  Not enough for me to not like them, but they are slightly uncomfortable.  They are a lot thinner as well.  They do not feel as sturdy.  Over all I do like them.', 'I wish they would make these jeans the way they used to make them. Namely, with the longer front pockets and without the high elastic content. They are okay, but preferred the previous fabric and pocket style.', 'The only thing I disliked was the way they fit.  I am losing weight so I had to go with my size because the bigger size is too big but they were tight in the stomach area and they were tight all day.', 'Fast shipping. Fit great. No color fade I washed  three times. No shrinking from dryer. Front pockets could be deeper, but the back ones fine to put my phone in.', 'I do not really care for the color or the feel of the fabric of these jeans. I like my Rider jeans from several years ago better. But, they are worn out and I needed new ones. I tried five times in store to find a pair I liked with no luck. I would get the fabric and/or color only to realize I could not get them over my thighs or it would show too much of my butt even though they were supposed to be my size. The jeans I purchased are comfortable and fit well without showing what I don\'t want out there. Get rid of the words ""skinny"", ""flare leg"", and ""low rise"" and make jeans for active 40ish women who want comfort to go with quality in colors that look nice. I would be much happier with my wardrobe!', 'I have been wearing this style jean for years. It is a classic at-the-waist jean. When I finally found jeans without bling on the butt or hip hugger style that fit, I bought several pair. I had bought this style in the store and then the store no longer carried them. I found the style number online and ordered several pair. This time, the style changed slightly (even though the style numbers remained the same). The fabric has a little more stretch than before and the cut is slightly larger. I ordered my regular size and returned them for a smaller size. These do not have the leather LEE label on the waistband. The fabric is a firm medium weight and the color is even (no bleached-out look). They are comfortable and look good with a blazer or sweatshirt.', 'I\'ve been hunting for jeans for months, as i had ""outgrown"" my last pairs.

I\'m 5\' 8"", and recently reached 162 lbs.:( I blame being 54 years old for this. After trying size 14 (too tight!), skipping rite up to size 18 (too loose!), I tried different manufacturers in size 16. The Classic fit and the waist-height rise are exactly what I\'ve been looking for. Helps hold in my tummy without cutting off my circulation at the waist! The legs are just loose enough that I can move around but not so loose that they look sloppy. They\'re just a touch long even on my long legs but one wash brings them to just the right length. These are terrific and I now have purchased 3 pairs exactly the same. I\'m very pleased with these jeans.', ""I know lots of reviews have said they don't like the new material used in making the black Lee jeans but I like it. It has enough stretch to hug me but still looks great. I love the fit of the relaxed fit & the higher waist. it gives me a waist line again. Thank you Lee Jeans for bringing back a classic look. My husband said my butt looks great in these jeans. I will be sure to purchase more. I would love to see this style and fit in some bright colors since that is the style now. Thanks again Lee Jeans!"", 'The manufacturer tag indicates that these are slimmer through the hip & thigh. If the online description had included that information I could have saved myself a return. If you have curvy, muscular thighs this is probably not the style for you.\nI did like the dark denim color and the embroidery on the pockets is not over the top like some. Would have kept if the style had standard fit thighs.\nNote: this is the thin stretchy denim.

The wrap around part has a wide facing liner that is one and a half inches across. This facing runs from the bottom edge, up to the tie, around the neckline, and back down to the opposite bottom edge of the blouse. This is a nice, dress-up type of top that can be paired with a skirt or slacks for a dressy look or it can be toned down with a pair of jeans.

I wear sports bras often and in this heat it gets Mighty hot because they get squished together so I have to put a lot of baby powder there but with this bra I don't have to put so much baby powder to keep dry because this bra still separates. I will never go back two wires again. it is sad how bras are expensive with as little material as they are and their mass-produced so it really doesn't cost anything to make them.

See through material.', ""I ordered the black 2-pack in small. I weighed 117 lb pre-pregnancy and now I'm around 138 lbs in week 30 (but still with a small frame - I'm carrying all in the front), and these fit me as I would expect. There is a little bagginess in the waist area, but most maternity pants/bottoms I have seem to be this way to allow expansion as your bump grows.\n\nThe biggest pro for me is the value of these - I couldn't find a 2-pack for this price anywhere else. Most places price one pair at this price, and since I'm basically living in leggings right now, I need multiple pairs. The color and opaqueness is about what you would expect from any standard pair of cotton leggings. I'm satisfied with it!\n\nThe biggest con for me would probably be the bump panel/waistband. I do prefer the bump panels to be that more spandexy material, but again, these were such a good price. I have a really nice pair of leggings with the panel material I like and they were probably more like $20-$25 for one pair. The elastic waistband is kind of weird. It's thicker and bunchier than most panel waistbands, so it's not as comfortable, but I have some belly bands I like to wear for the tight support feeling, so I wear one of those under this panel and it provides me with the supportive feeling I like and makes the waistband substantially less noticeable and substantially more comfortable.\n\nOverall, don't expect a super high quality pair of leggings when you order these - they're only like $7.50 each! Go into the purchase expecting a very standard pair of cotton leggings and you will be satisfied! If you want a really nice pair and are okay with spending more, go for it! If you want a few more bump-friendly bottoms to wear without having to spend a ton on clothes you'll only wear in certain phases of your life (like me!), these are a perfect option for you!"", ""I'd rather wear sweatpants lol but they're good for if I want to look nice.\nThe band on the belly is a little uncomfortable but not awful. Would be better if it was a wide smooth band, but it's narrow and sort of bunched up. The material is nice. They are kinda see through if you bend over really far. But c'mon, you're pregnant, how much and how far are you really going to be bending over?""]","['Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 24 ratings , based on 24 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 24 ratings , based on 24 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 24 ratings , based on 24 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 24 ratings , based on 24 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 24 ratings , based on 24 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 24 ratings , based on 24 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 4.0 ) out of 5 stars 24 ratings , based on 24 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 3.0 ) out of 5 stars 24 ratings , based on 24 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 2.0 ) out of 5 stars 24 ratings , based on 24 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 1.0 ) out of 5 stars 24 ratings , based on 24 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 24 ratings , based on 24 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 24 ratings , based on 24 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 24 ratings , based on 24 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 24 ratings , based on 24 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 24 ratings , based on 24 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 24 ratings , based on 24 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 3.0 ) out of 5 stars 24 ratings , based on 24 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 4.0 ) out of 5 stars 24 ratings , based on 24 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 3.0 ) out of 5 stars 24 ratings , based on 24 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 24 ratings , based on 24 reviews']"

It's very soft, so it's a better dress to wear during the fall or spring when it's warmer. The length is just at the knee.

It is a long sleeve, but it has buttons so you can roll them up if you'd like. The dress is flattering since it has a belt to tie and accentuate your waist. It buttons all the way down w/ a nice collar at the top. I personally do not have it all buttoned up b/c it'll make me feel too stuffy, but I think you could wear it either way. The color is a nice dark blue so you can wear the dress w/ any type of shoe color. I wore it the other night w/ my black flats! I received so many compliments on my dress. I highly recommend this dress for anyone looking for a semi-professional attire that's comfortable and looks great."", ""I bought this dress in both the blue and the navy because I love the versatility of shirt dresses and this looked like a classic style.

I found the fit to be tight but also loose - I wasnt sure if a size up or down wouldve helped! Im 128lbs, I ordered a size 26 but it wasnt as tight in the waist and butt as I expected. Although, at the same time I found that the zipper was very... weak to be tasked with holding you into stiff denim jeans! The zipper slid down twice when I was trying it on which would be very embarrassing in public, perhaps the quality is not very robust and strong.

I got them as I was running low on my normal black undies and these couldn't have done a better job at replacing them. These fit well and go high enough to smooth out the lumps and bumps and the coverage under your pants, shorts, etc. is great. I truly love these."", 'The description ""briefs"" means they should go up to the waist.  These do not.  They fall below the waist which is really uncomfortable.

The company trying to save money on materials does not make the product more attractive.', 'They say size 10 but fit like size 9. They need to be a bit bigger and looser on the legs. The pants themselves feel good and I hope they last a long time.', ""I purchased these to wear after giving birth to my son - they always say get a size bigger and high waist to hold everything in. For reference, I am 5'9 and at the time I was 255 lbs with a swollen stomach and legs, bottom heavy. Normally wear a 16/18 and XL in undies. They were way too tight on my legs and I bought a size 10. \n\nFast forward to now, 11 weeks postpartum and they fit comfortably. I'm now 232 and a size 16. They are really high and cover my whole but. The leg holes feel a little tight when I put them on but I just stretch it out with my hand and I'm good. They don't ride up which is nice. Definitely granny parties."", 'I bought two separate pkgs. One was all white 10 pack made in Thailand.  The fit is terrible. Not what I expected at all.

A big disappointment."", 'Very small, very rigid material, no stretch. Unfortunately I bought 5 packages and washed them before I tried them. They are several sizes smaller compared to the ones I bought a few years ago. During the past several years I switched to Cacique and love those ones.

These are horrible.  The binding around the legs is the kind that doesn't stretch.  Already washed them which is a bummer.  If I got in a medium no way would these be at all wearable. So now I Got Auden brand medium at target and perfect fit.  I usually like cotton but these even after washing are stiff like there is a fabric sizing in the material. \nI'm thinking I will be tossing all these."", 'Very comfortable and fit me well.

So what better panties are there to pair with casual/comfy? Hanes. That's it. So happy to have found them here at Walmart."", 'While the underwear itself is good, the sizing is not.

I bought them because I wanted something loose and cool to walk in.

I never put my pants in the dryer because one inch shorter and I can\'t wear them-the washing instructions suggest to hang dry anyway.

So comfortable. I wear a pair of these every day!', 'I ordered 2 pair of these pants.  They are so comfortable.  The only thing I noticed is they are a little bit to long.  As to the size, they are perfect.  I would highly recommend buying this pants.  I plan to order more in the near future.', 'Ok so first off i hope you dont want sweatpants because you wont be happy.

It is so hard to find women's pants with an inseam longer than 28 inches ."", ""I absolutely love these. Only problem is they are much longer then usual as I normally have to get bigger sizes to have the length. On the 2x I would say the length has inseam of 36-38. I'm a 33 and have to put below my bra to keep them from dragging on floor"", 'These pants are super comfortable as the draw string around the waist allows you to control how tight they are there. I bought a next size up because they were to be worn after an abdominal surgery when I couldnt wear my other pants. My only disappointment with them is they are VERY long. I am short at 5ft 3in and they wrap COMPLETELY under my feet and still have a few inches extra. Since Im not going anywhere right now, I just fold them up at the bottom and will hem them later. They serve their purpose for now.', ""These are seriously the best.  I'm always worried buying online, but the reviews were all great.  I went ahead and about two paid.  I need more now!  They are so comfy that you could wear them to the gym or just during the day out and about.

I had to shorten them 4 inches but that is okay.  They are not the fleecy type of sweatpants I\'m used to.  They are a much thinner material and very soft but I wouldn\'t describe them as sweatpants.   I must say I didn\'t realize the legs would be so wide.  If you can remember palazzo pants?  They are super wide like palazzo pants.  I will wear them at home and be comfortable but would never wear these wide legged pants in public.', 'My pair has a 32 and one half inch inseam, so I and others will have to hem them.  After washing in cold water and putting them in the dryer until damp the inseam remained the same.  Like other reviews said, they have the same cut and design as the Danskin item from years ago, except these have spandex in them which should be nice to keep their shape a little better after several hours of wear.  The fabric content is 62% cotton, 33% polyester and 5% spandex, and is slightly lighter weight than the Danskins were.  I still wear my Danskin ones and they have worn like iron.   They are NOT sweatpants!  They are a light to medium weight flat knit.  I like the weight since I run warm.  I can only hope they last as long as the Danskins have.', ""I probably shouldn't have gotten the size I got. I wear a 24 and bought a 4x. Its too big but it still fits so Im not complaining.

Not a thick material so probably not great for the winter but Im not counting it out yet because theyve kept me pretty warm."", ""I ordered these because I am looking for more pants like I already had.  This is the same company and nearly the same cut.  The material is probably the same, as is the color.  All in all, I'm happy.

I ordered a size up and I am swimming in it but I like that I rather have it fold over me than have it have a gap in front.

However, the band size is very small. I'm a 34 (on the tightest hook) and can wear a lot of 32s. I got a 34ddd and I can only wear it on the loosest hook and it's tight. Also, I am small shouldered and the cups rub under my arms. I wear them around the house and for quick errands but wouldn't wear them out all day as they are start to bother me under my arms.  also a lot of movement in them and I have spillage.

Like most people have said the band size is undersized by one size but bras do stretch as they wear so this won't be the problem with this bra because I have plenty of band to go. The cups are not sized right - A little bigger than advertised but close enough that I fill 98% of it and nothing is going to wrinkle. I probably will keep it for the price. All of me is contained and everything is in the right place and the gore sits flat on my chest, I have plenty of shoulder strap and I think I can get used to the band because I still am in good shape so I have enough muscle and the band doesn't cut in anymore than a little.\n\nMain conclusion is that they're not perfect but you can't really expect much at this price for two bras so I think you have to be reasonable in your expectations and don't critique it like a $60 bra because it isn't $60 - it's not even half. If they fixed these two issues (I don't know about the deforming from washing them because I just have them now), I will buy another pack or two.\n\nOf course it would be great to pick your color combination."", 'Perfect fit!

I would have ordered smaller. the underwire sticks out a bit too far because though the cup is well fitted it's too loose underneath and the underwire stretches out beyond the actual cup which is...weird. Also, I really wish you could adjust the straps higher but you can't. it deserves 2 stars but I'm giving it 3 if you just want some loose off day support.

They just married the two for this Secret Treasure one. I overall love the fit. I buy one cup smaller though, otherwise it's too big. I like the coverage, and the straps do not dig into my shoulders. Bonus! My biggest issue is the underwire. Looking at my purchase history, I have bought 22 of these bras in 4 years! And the reason being, the underwire either snaps in two on the right side, or the underwire pokes through the ends on either the inside or outside. I literally have a graveyard of useless bras due to the underwire! I cannot find a customer service number for Secret Treasures to ask them about it, and Walmart customer service was nice enough to give me a promo code, but I have to spend $45 to get a $25 credit. My most recent purchase was on May 20th. After wearing 11 times, I alternate to wash, the underwire snapped on me today!! I can't seem to find anything that fits better, and when I try to sew the unbroken underwires back into the bra, the thread rubs me uncomfortably."", 'the underwire does not come up to the edge of the babd therefore  it sticks into the breast. the tag next to the hook and eyes is stiff and constantly scratcging you back.  I would return these bras if I had not already washed them.', ""First bra to fit me perfectly!  I watched a tutorial on the proper way to measure for a bra.  So when I purchased these they fit and are very comfortable.  I was delighted with the shape these gave me as well as the price.  I have a lot of side budge which this keeps in check quite well.  I haven't had to pull and tug all day like my previous bras., and the straps are wide and a bit padded to prevent digging.  These give me a nice shape to my girls, and I think this bra is simple yet pretty, providing smooth lines under my clothes."", ""Love the way this bra fits!\n\nI was really happy to find that this is a proper FF bra, designed for busty women, rather than just an infuriating dainty design made for an A-cup but scaled up to a DDD.  Wide, padded shoulder straps, wide wings to cut down on the side-boob, a three hook closure, underwires and foam cups to prevent the dreaded uni-boob... Well done!\n\nEven though the fabric is pretty basic, it's actually quite pretty -- there's a lacy mesh stretched over the satin fabric, giving it subtle texture, but not enough to show up through clothes. \n\nWill definitely buy more of these! For the price it can't be beat!"", 'The straps are so comfortable for a 42DDD and a perfect fit.', 'Comfortable for my large breasts.  Good fit.', 'you will not even know you have it on.', ""Color is nice  and it is very comfortable. Straps don't go tight enough though which is annoying because it will no longer be a push up if it's too loose. ."", 'Straps slip down, needs side support option as the wires dont hold much up for long. It would be comfortable with the fabric but the support is flimsy to me. The bounce test was a fail. Too much shifting for the girls.', ""Absolutely LOVE this bra. Was skeptical buying online without a fitting session. Fits perfectly and I'm buying two more today. Nice bargain for a great bra."", 'I really like this bra. I find the fit and comfort to be perfect. The problem I had is that after 2 months, the underwire on the right side snapped and broke. I have ordered the same exact bra because of how comfortable it is. Time will tell of the underwire is an issue with the new bra.', ""For a full-figured woman, support and comfort are not always easy to find in the same bra. The Secret Treasures Women's Full Figure Underwire T-Shirt Bra is the most comfortable bra I've found with this level of support. The underwires tend to break, but not so soon that it makes the bra a bad purchase. I've purchased at least four of these, and I'm wearing one now. The best thing I can say about a bra is I would rather wear it than go without, and I can say that of this one. The elastic is as comfortable as it can be and still support, the straps don't dig into my shoulders too much, and the cups are soft with no seams. The reason I bought this bra the first time was the reasonable price. The prices for bras for busty women can be fairly prohibitive, so when I saw this it seemed logical to give it a chance. I'm so glad I did. Good-bye, $50 bras!""]","['Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 338 ratings , based on 338 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 338 ratings , based on 338 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 338 ratings , based on 338 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 338 ratings , based on 338 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 338 ratings , based on 338 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 338 ratings , based on 338 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 338 ratings , based on 338 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 4.0 ) out of 5 stars 338 ratings , based on 338 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 3.0 ) out of 5 stars 338 ratings , based on 338 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 3.0 ) out of 5 stars 338 ratings , based on 338 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 338 ratings , based on 338 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 338 ratings , based on 338 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 338 ratings , based on 338 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 338 ratings , based on 338 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 338 ratings , based on 338 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 4.0 ) out of 5 stars 338 ratings , based on 338 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 3.0 ) out of 5 stars 338 ratings , based on 338 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 338 ratings , based on 338 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 3.0 ) out of 5 stars 338 ratings , based on 338 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 4.0 ) out of 5 stars 338 ratings , based on 338 reviews']"

They are great. The leggins are made very well with a nice strong stich. Made with great material also. I like.how I can basically wear these with anything, they go good with all types of shirts, swaeters, or a jacket. The best thing I like.about them is how comfortable they are, very nice pair of leggins. I would definitely recommend if your looking for comfort pants.', 'This pants are soft ,hold shape and look great. They can be dressed up or down and you remain comfortable. They have a tapered bottom which easily tucks into boots or falls at the ankle length for shoes. The high waist band is wider but very soft. The weight is great because they are not heavy yet not thin, allowing coverage and smoothing. They are made of of 56% cotton 36 % modal, and 8% spandex providing the perfect softness and still hold shape. They are machine washable on cold and can be dried on low. They wash well not fading and keeping shape. Overall a great multi use pair of pants.', ""Terra & Sky Women's Plus Size Soft Full-Length Legging - Black, Size 4X I decided to get the 4x because I wear 2x and you know how sometimes you buy stuff like this and the sizing is off well these were just a little big but I'm comfortable wearing these and moving around they are comfortable. The length is just right and the waist is just a little big but they are comfortable just the way they are. The thing about leggings you can wear them around the house, gym, going out on the town, etc. I wear mine around the house because I like being comfortable."", ""Woo hoo!! I absolutely love these leggings! I wasn't expecting them to be as soft as they are. I bought them to wear at home when I'm just chilling and these are going to be perfect for that. They are so comfortable and yeah, I understand they are designed to be, but this is my first pair of leggings and I was pleasantly surprised by exactly how soft and wonderful they were."", ""I'm a large lady and I was worried about the sizing being off so I ordered up a size and while this is going to make them free and easy to move around the house and laze a few holiday days away, I could have stayed with my normal size and it would have been fine."", ""I did notice that when I placed these on a particular surface, it picked up a lot of lint. I don't know if that's common for leggings or not, but if this were a pair I wore into public, I'd be concerned they would allow every particle I brushed up against to stick to me."", ""I sense that I may have just started an addiction to clothing that doesn't feel like clothing and I totally understand why so many women choose to wear leggings."", ""These Terra & Sky Leggings are extremely soft and comfortable. I knew as soon as I was opening the package and I felt the material that it was a good quality. They we're thick enough to not see thru, and super plush and soft. Then when I put them on, my goodness, these are the most comfortable pair that I own now and I have like six. They fit just right for a quite curvy girl like me, the size is spot on, and I'm not easy to fit with my dimensions. I will buy another pair next shopping stint. Definitely a great buy."", ""I received my Terra and Sky women's plus size soft full length legging. It is black and size 5X. It is made of 56% cotton, 36% model and 8% spandex jersey with a wide waistband that is very comfortable. It has a 4 way stretch fabric with gusset at the crotch to boost you up with out strain. The fabric is very soft. It was easy to get on which I've had a problem with others that didn't stretch as well. Because it comes in other colors I may get more because of the way they fit. And it is a good value. I've recommended it to a few people and they are going to check them out."", ""I got the black size 0x (14W) size leggings from Terra & Sky. They are high rise and fitted but not tight. Even though I don't have long legs, I am about 5'8 ¬Ω‚Äù tall and so often leggings are too short for me. These are the perfect length. They are made of 56% Cotton, 36% Modal blended jersey, and 8% Spandex Jersey. I just know they are really soft and extremely comfortable. They stretch and move with me regardless of what I'm doing. No uncomfort, pinching, or binding. They have a wide waistband, which I wasn't sure I would like, but it is comfortable and seems to provide a bit of added support. I have tried many leggings and yoga pants that are not flattering. These are very flattering when it comes to my curves. I was a bit concerned about the gusset at the crotch but it does not bind or cause any discomfort. They came out of the wash without any issues. It states they can be dried but I only dried them a short time because I have an old dryer that gets cloths very hot. I then finished drying them by hanging them up. They didn't wrinkle and looked great. I have not had them very long but I don't have anything negative to say about these leggings. I recommend these leggings."", ""I didn't realize I had ordered size 5x before I clicked confirm, so that is on me. I wasn't able to wear them because they were far too big, but the quality of the leggings is great. The fabric is soft and comfortable feeling, as advertised, and the seams are even and strong. I have several articles of clothing from Terra & Sky and it is a good brand that holds up well. I will probably end up ordering these in the correct size because they look and feel so comfortable."", ""I have never been a fan of any sort of leggings. That is until I found these. They are extremely soft and so very comfortable, I don't know why I waited so long to try other brands. They have just the right amount of stretch in the legs and in the waistband and they are perfect for every day use. I went a size up in pants just so I can have that extra comfy factor and I am so glad that I did so. I would highly recommend these amazing leggings"", 'My number 1 requirement for leggings is that they pass the stretch test. I stretched these to the limit and they still had good coverage. The fabric is nice and soft and very comfortable for a whole day of wear.', 'My only complaint is that the length is a little short. As capris, these would be great. Even as 3/4 length. But I wouldn\'t say they are full length. If you are 5\' 8"" or taller, plan on them not hitting all the way at your ankle.', 'I recieved this pants the other day and have wore them twice. Pros: the material feel nice and soft not ruff at all so they are definitely easy and flexible wear for all day. You can dress them up or down they are are very versatile. The waist band I don like very much how wide it is so it does not give the muffin top look (if you have that issue) it allows tops to lay nice and smoothly. Cons: The material will pick up some lent (not extremely bad) and if you have pets that shed I highly recommend being careful it you are planning wearing them out. I also definitely reccomend to be careful what other materials you choose to wash them with if you do not want to hand wash. I will say though I did not have issue with much shrinkage in the dryer. I would recommend these I would love to have a pair that are bootcut and different styles.', 'These leggings are excellent! They are soft and comfortable just like it says. These are perfect for lounging or paired with a oversized sweater for going out in public. They hold their shape very well and are completely true to size. Just the right length also.

I'm definitely getting more of these !"", ""These are soooooooooooooo comfortable and soft. They fit nice and are not sse through which is a huge deal. They surprising didn't shrink in the dryer. Pretty impressed."", ""Supposed to receive on Thursday, September 17th, but didn't receive until Tuesday, September 22nd. As with other package, there was a tear and what appeared to be a burn mark on the bag. There are three spots on the leggings themselves. And again, as with the other package, there was dirt and grit all over the leggings."", 'Super comfortable. I bought two pairs at the store and as soon as I wore one pair I went to Walmart.com and bought about 7 more pairs. They are the right price, right fit and so comfortable. I could live in these 24/7.

They go well with pants and also with a dress. They have a classic look with a modern twist (snake print). The memory foam insole makes it very comfortable on the bottom. Even though at first they don't seem to be true to size (they seemed kind of small), after a few uses I realized it is indeed true to size. I normally wear a 7 and I got these in 7. My only concern is that it is very tight - as these type of shoes need to be, so they don't fall off of the feet - and it took about three uses for me to break them in and for them to start to feel comfortable. First couple of uses my heels hurt a little. But it gets better. I guess this is a problem we have to face with any new pair of shoes. But rest assured that it gets better. I thought the toes would be compressed in the front because of the shoe format, but I didn't have any issues with that. I was worried it would look like cheaply made, but that's not the case. It looks pretty and fancy, what you would expect from an expensive / brand name pair of shoes, but at a fraction of the price. Now I just have to wait for the weather to get better again so I can wear these shoes more often."", 'Love the snakeskin print! I got these in size 9 (regular width, I have narrow feet) and they are a bit snug and stiff, and rub on the backs of my ankles a bit. They probably need to be worn in, hopefully that will help. I personally would size up a half-size or try the wide too, just to compare.', 'These shoes were very cute, they have a memory foam padding which actually makes them feel better. They have a very pointy toe but does not squish the toes. My foot is very flat no arch support at all.I feel this made the shoe kinda come out on side. But overall easy to wear and very cute,', ""The Time and Tru Animal Print Feather Flat shoes are really cute, and they're actually very comfortable. The only thing I'd say about these though is to order a size up from what you need. I ordered a half size up than I usually wear because they're so pointed at the end, but they were still a little snug. If you order these online, I'd say order at least a half size larger than your normal shoe size."", ""Great shoe though! They're easy to wear, don't hurt my feet, and they bend easily on the bottom."", 'I really like Time and Tru Animal Print Feather Flat shoes.', 'I\'m normally a size 7.5 so that\'s what I ordered. They run about one half of a size too big. While they will still work for me, they are slightly long and a bit wide. I do have fairly narrow feet, but not enough to order narrow width shoes. They do look more expensive than they are, and you can dress them up or down. I love jeans, so I will mostly be wearing them with that. I wouldn\'t rely on these shoes for more than four straight hours of walking, because they don\'t really feel that ""durable."" However, they would more than satisfy a casual night out, with intermittent sitting. I would recommend these shoes to those on a budget, and those who are looking for a nice pair of shoes for short events.', 'They are very narrow even for the regular size. I am wearing a 7.5 but barely could fit in 8.0. Looks like I should take 9.0. Not comfortable, rough material. I would not recommend it. Yes, it looks nice but your feet are small enough you can go for it.', 'These are cute snakeskin print flats. They are comfortable enough to wear all day. I wore them with jeans, leggings, and dresses. They are a black/gray print with a rubber sole.', ""I got these shoes for my daughter who is a size 6 and a half they seemed a little bit big on her but she'll grow into them. Shoes have memory foam cushion for an insole which is quite comfortable . The shoes have a pretty snakeskin design."", ""I requested a size 6 and they fit perfectly, mostly. I wear them to work with some black slacks and they add a little something extra to my outfit. The are comfortable for daily wear and it's easy to slide in and out of them."", ""I'm obsessed with this print. I can't believe I found these shoes. Gorgeous, great fit and I get so many compliments. The fit was on point and they don't pinch. I'm wearing them all day, everyday."", 'I bought these to replace last years time', ""These have a nice flair and an expensive look. Nice finish. The only negatives I've noticed is they're pretty pointed so you can kind of tell that on your toes. But I have a wide foot. If you have a medium or narrow foot you'd never notice. They gap a little but again that may be my wide foot. They are a bit snug but I used to fit shoes at a shoe store and flats should always be a little snug in the beginning."", 'These were so cute in person.

It just sags and makes your pants fit weird. The waistband is not comfortable at all; it's a wide piece of elastic that's scratchy and has a big seam where it's sewn to the top of the underwear, which rubs you. The fabric is thick and terrible and adds to the bulky feeling under your clothes. These might be okay to wear to sleep in, but definitely not for wearing under actual clothes unless you like the feeling of having a pair of ill-fitting shorts on under your jeans.

Later purchased 3 more online in different colors."", ""Originally I got the wrong size (fitting rooms are closed now), but the exchange process is so easy in Walmart, so I got the right one at my next visit.  I'm super happy with my purchase. Great quality."", 'This has become my favorite bra. It is soft, smooth, and holds everywhere in place. The only thing I dislike is the area of the underwire seems to become misshapen over time. Maybe that is just a hint that its time for a new one!', 'It fit larger around than my other 40C brands.  Started falling apart after the 2nd wash.  It was comfortable but I had to throw it away. So not worth the money even if it was inexpensive for a Warner bra', ""I really love this bra.

This is a beautiful line of of intimates from Warners. Ordered in tan, black and white. Straps are comfortable and they stay put. The underarm smoothing panel really works to smooth under the arm. Ordered in size 36C. Fits perfectly. I wish the walmart stores had these. They use to carry them. Made from 78% Rayon, 22 % elastane the sides 76% Rayon and 24 % elastane. Again very pretty and comfortable. I recommend this bra for comfort and style. Washes in cold water. Air dry.', ""I can't find anything negative to say about this bra! I love the material, it is soft and non - binding. I love the extra coverage on the sides and back that it provides. The fact that it doesn't have that extra seam under the arm with a plastic stay in it that gets bent and pinches you is a great plus for me, as those things always hit in the most uncomfortable way and usually cause much irritation.\n\nIt wraps around and hugs you is the only way I know how to describe it. It doesn't roll down and let the back fat spill over for me like other bras that have the stays and are stiffer materials. The cups are not too thick or bulky like some of the foam cups can be and they are a great fit. Not too low or too high cut and I think will work well with most necklines, unless you are wearing a super deep plunging one. The straps are stretchy but not too stretchy and are adjustable to create a perfect fit for anyone.\n\nIt's proportioned in such a way that it is an excellent bra for any figure, from full figure to petite I think it is an all-around good fit.\nAll and all a great bra!"", ""I normally wear Warners bras. Style 1593 in size 34C and it's an almost perfect fit. It is a full coverage padded underwire bra (which I really needed 5 years after having a baby‚Ä¶let's just say the girls weren't as perky as they were before having a child and breast feeding). While I don't usually have an underarm pudge problem I do find it really hard to find a bra that fits me just right. A demi bra fits me well in the underarm area but I need full coverage otherwise the girls flop out when I bend over and most full coverage bras come up too high in the underarm area and cut me at the armpits.\n\nI ordered The Warners Blissful Benefits Underarm Smoothing bra (size 34C nude color). The color was perfect and blended nicely with my skin so you couldn't see it through a thin white t-shirt. It provided ample coverage. The underwire was comfortable and the cup size was right on target. For me the padding was a little thin but I am used to a heavily padded bra. Even so the Blissful Benefits did its job and did it well. The underarm smoothing feature was a really nice perk. Unfortunately it was a little too high for me. I think it would be a great feature for someone that finds a general full coverage bra fits well. While I am normally a 34 I think I could have used a 32 in this bra because I found it was a little loose and tended to slide around during the course of the day. I've worn the bra twice and washed it twice (I put it in the wash machine in a delicate bag with my other bras on the delicate cycle and it came out fine). All things considered I'd recommend this bra to someone else but I don't think I'd purchase it for myself because it wasn't the perfect fit for me. I'm 5'4‚Äù tall & 135 lbs. Hopefully this review will help you find the right bra.""]","['Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 388 ratings , based on 388 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 388 ratings , based on 388 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 388 ratings , based on 388 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 388 ratings , based on 388 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 388 ratings , based on 388 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 388 ratings , based on 388 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 4.0 ) out of 5 stars 388 ratings , based on 388 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 3.0 ) out of 5 stars 388 ratings , based on 388 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 3.0 ) out of 5 stars 388 ratings , based on 388 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 1.0 ) out of 5 stars 388 ratings , based on 388 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 388 ratings , based on 388 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 388 ratings , based on 388 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 388 ratings , based on 388 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 388 ratings , based on 388 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 388 ratings , based on 388 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 2.0 ) out of 5 stars 388 ratings , based on 388 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 388 ratings , based on 388 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 388 ratings , based on 388 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 388 ratings , based on 388 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 4.0 ) out of 5 stars 388 ratings , based on 388 reviews']"

The price was great and I am thinking about ordering some more in other colors. The only problem I have with them is that I don't want to take them off.

So now these are my at home lounge pants. Still a win! Great material although after a couple washes they are starting to fade already."", ""As mentioned by others, unless you're a 7 foot amazonian expect to have to get these hemmed.

I wear a 6.5 normally so that is the size I chose. The 6.5 fit but a little snug. Not too snug to where I can't wear them though and I bet as I wear them even more they will loosen up some. The color is the perfect olive color. Pair them with some skinny jeans, a wine red shirt and black cardigan and you got the perfect fall look. The heel is the perfect height and isn't too big. The zipper on the side has cute tassels that hang off. For the price these boots are very well made and look great!"", ""The Wonder Time Tru Zipper Bootie's wide width is man made of leather looking material ,but is not leather .The Boots are very well stitch and has a one inch heel that is easy to walk in. They also have memory foam inside which are very comfortable for you feet.The zipper is very sturdy and easy to zip with the tassel when putting on or off boots.The boots are have a cuff stitch on top front which gives a nice look .These boots are ankle length and , are causal to wear with a dress, skirt, shorts or pants .The bottom sole of boots have ridges so not to slip to easily. I look forward to wear my boots in comfort out."", 'This os a cute bootie with a nice size heel. Not too high therefore you can wear it for an extended period of time without your feet starting to ache which is a huge plus. Perfect for work, church or a night out. The part of the shoe that sits right on top of your foot is a little hard/stiff which is expected from a brand new shoe but after some wear it will loosen up. Just have to break it in. Even with that, I would still recommend this shoe.', ""Comfortable cushion bottom. Nice to have wide width available for those of us with a wider foot. Cute tassel on the zipper. I love a good boot that hits at the right spot and doesn't have a super tall heel. These have the perfect heel height, not too tall and the top hits perfectly right at the ankle. Can't wait for the fall season! Highly Recommend!"", ""I received a free pair of Time and Tru  Zipper Bootie (brown) to try out , review and keep on behalf of the Walmart Spark program.  Because I love absolutely everything about them, I immediately ordered the same pair but in black.  I live in jeans and boots throughout fall, winter and early spring.  That means I need boots that fit and feel great on my feet and hold up well as they'll be worn 6 months straight. I'm not a fan of high heeled anything. lol.  These boots have a nice, roughly 2 inch heel to them.  Perfect for me! The design is pretty simple and basic-nothing super fancy. I like this as well.  Each bootie has a zipper on the outer part of the boot which is easy to zip and unzip without issue. Because I have wide feet and high arches, I did order the wide width boots. I highly recommend you do the same if you have similar feet issues.  For me, the best part about Time and Tru is the fabulous memory foam insoles.  Not only do they provide wonderful support for my feet, they feel FANTASTIC! The booties are very well made also. Precise and strong stitching, no scuffs or marks of any kind. The day my brown booties arrived, I wore them around the house to test them for my review.  My feet felt wonderful. They were comfortable the entire time I had the boots on. (I did wear them for a significant amount of time!) My feet did not become sore, tired or achy at all.  I knew these were the boots for me and immediately ordered a pair in black as well.  And the price of these gems can't be beat! If you're in need of some VERY comfortable booties that look awesome with jeans or dress pants, you're going to want to give Time and Tru a try.  Your feet will not only look great, they'll FEEL great too!"", ""If you're looking for a pair of basic booties that will go with almost anything but still have a flair for on-point fashion, these shoes are a great fit for you. The zipper on the outside of the shoe, rather than the more typical zipper near the inside ankle, helps the look of these booties to stand out from the crowd. Having the zipper on the opposite side of the shoe may play tricks with your muscle memory when you first put the shoe on, so they're not quite slip-on and go, but it's well worth the trade off. These booties are comfortable, but they do run a bit narrow. Overall, these are a great addition to my wardrobe."", ""My feet are about a size 7 1/2. But my lower body is paralyzed, making it difficult to get certain styles of shoes on my feet, so I generally have to order a size 8. I have trouble especially with boots of any kind. So when I ordered these booties in Size 7, I fully expected that I wouldn't be able to wear them and I'd have to give them to my daughter (which would have been fine, as she likes them, too). Still, out of an undying hope I might finally find a bootie I can wear, I tried them on as soon as they arrived. Holy moly! THEY FIT!! And beautifully, too! So then I took a really good look at them. They are really nice boots with a zipper on the side. (Note: the zipper is on the outside of this boot rather than the inside.) The stitching is good, the color is matte, the insole is made of memory foam, and the soles are non-skid. The zipper slides up and down smoothly enough and has a short leather pull to help. These booties will go with so many looks, but I will be wearing them with leggings and a tunic as my autumnal uniform!"", ""I guess it's the wide fit that makes it possible for me to get my feet into these booties, but I suspect they might run a bit large, anyway, so order with that in mind. Overall, I am really impressed with the quality and look of these booties. If I could change one thing, it might be that I'd prefer the zipper to be on the *inside* (as in, the inner ankle part) so as to leave a smoother look on the more visible part of the boot. But the zipper looks good, too, so that is a very minor thing. I really love these booties, and I can't wait to start wearing them all the time this fall!"", ""Overall, I like the boots. They will be a nice addition to my fall and winter wardrobe. It's currently summer and I could not wear these all day. This review is based on wearing the boots for about 30 minutes at a time wow walking around my home. Minus one star because the shoe lacks an appropriate cushioned insert."", 'In my opinion, the boots are stylish. I always purchase boots one size larger. These Boots are in 11 wide and they fit my foot perfectly. May have issues when I attempt to wear these with thicker socks but I have not tried it yet. I think these boots are a solid bet for occasional wear in the upcoming season.', 'The color is a nice, cognac brown.', ""These shoes are made well. When I first got them, the first thing that stood out to me was it's weight. These are not made from the consistent cheap material that you see most shoes being made from now a days. It looks sleek. I love that the shoe was very spacious. As soon as my daughter saw the shoes, she said I want them. She's 17 years old. I thought these were like $30-$40, but they left the price tag on them and boy was I shocked. For less than $15, this is for sure a steal. I'm a huge Walmart shopper, I've not seen this quality for this price at all."", ""These booties are pretty cute. I ordered a 8W, and sometimes it just depends on the shoe if it will fit right or not. I also tried it without socks on so that could have played a part in this, but the shoes were a bit big on me. Nothing terrible. They were comfortable. I like the way they feel. The leather is soft. I love the zipper side, that adds the bit of flare they were missing. I'd like to try these with a pair of jeans on to see how they look. I'm not a huge fan of pointed toe shoes, and they're not exactly pointed in my opinion, more pointed/rounded, but still I would've preferred more round tip. They are cute though overall. If they had a gray suede version I would like them a lot more. Like I said though, they are comfortable when you walk, they are not too high, and I would give them an 8 out of 10 if I could. I believe if you like booties, then you will like these."", 'These are super cute zipper half boots in a lovely taupe color. I usually wear a seven and a half and sometimes an eight. I got theses online in a seven and a half but would probably prefer them a half size larger to an eight. Unfortunately, I do not see them in the store so I am not sure that I will pursue exchanging the size. The toe area comes too much to a point and squishes my toes uncomfortably. I have yet to walk in them all day and only have briefly tried them on. I tried them on with some lightweight socks as I would usually wear with half boots. I was pleasantly surprised, however, to find that there was a pretty good support for my arch. This has been a constant difficulty to find in any shoe and would seem to me to be a fantastic benefit of this half boot. The boot zips on the outside of the leg which is fantastic and so the zippers will not bang against each other as you walk. The zippers showcase a cute, decorative tassel which can aid in pulling the zipper up and down. The taupe color is great because of how it can basically match everything and anything. There is a soft, pho, brushed leather material constructing the outside of the half boot. With other shoes I have had with a similar material I find it can be scratched easily but with these boots I can run my fingernails across the surface and can see no scratch at all. These half boots also come with a memory foam on the bottom which actually provides great comfort. I have found that time and true products are a fantastic quality and are among my favorite pieces to wear.', 'I loved these boots. They look good after wearing and great for autumn and winter wear. I felt they were a little stiff on the first wear but slowly have been becoming more comfortable with use. The zipper looks good quality and will last long.', 'This is a pair of W TT ZIPPER BOOTIE WW (Black, 6.5# Wide), they are ankle high boots', 'with a side zipper , the insole is made of memory foam ,making these boots very', 'comfortable to wear. They have a sleek design that can be worn with any outfit.', 'These W TT ZIPPER BOOTIE WW (Black, 6.5# Wide), are a great addition to any', 'wardrobe.', ""These shoes are pretty nice. I love the look. They are very trendy. I can also appreciate how low to the ground they are. That will help to make them much more comfortable to walk in. Even though they are low heeled they still look very nice and fashionable. I can tell they are not leather though. They have more of the cheaper look but they're still nice nonetheless. I really like the line of the shoe around the ankle. It's not a straight line so it adds to the design making it look even nicer. The inside of the shoe says memory foam so that's always a plus. It helps to have comfortable shoes as there were no sharp or rough edges squeezing my feet. overall these are pretty nice shoes and I would recommend."", 'I received the Time and True Zipper Booties.', ""They are so cute. I got a wide width as I have wide feet and they are so comfortable. They have the memory foam soals. My foot does not slide in them and I can wear them all day with no problems. I love the deep rich brown color. They have the zippers on the outside of the bootie. They have a good amount of tread for safety. They run true to size. I can't wait until Fall, they will go with so many outfits. The Time and True Zipper Booties are a quality item, I like the Time and True brand. You get quality at a good price. I really like them and I can't wait to wear them. I highly recommend these Booties."", ""I normally order an 8 1/2 in boots but they didn't have that size so I ordered a 9. I have wide feet and was a little hesitant. They came in, I put them on and they're perfect! I have worn them all day with no pain. I still have some room so if I want to wear thick socks but they don't fall off when I walk so that's a plus. Love the material and the heel is perfect. Nice stylish bootie that goes with almost everything"", ""I love the color of these brown boots and they are so comfortable! They go well with any color jeans, imo. They run true to size and I needed to get the wide, which is great for my foot. The heel is the perfect height for walking around at work or out shopping. They look nice. The only thing I find odd is that the zipper is on the outer side of the boot rather than on the inside. On all of my other boots, the zippers touch when my feet are together. But my pants cover the zipper part anyway, so it's not a big deal."", 'I absolutely love these ankle high boots. They are so cute and stylish. They are a perfect boot for any occasion and go well with almost any style of clothing you have. I have worn them to work as well as out on the town. They are extremely comfortable and the block heel is the perfect height for me. The memory foam insoles add much needed comfort and support to my feet. I wore them all day at work and my feet never hurt. I even wore them while shopping and never once had any foot pain.', 'I really like the look and feel of these boots. You can definitely tell that they are very well made and very durable. The rubber bottoms have ridges which makes me feel comfortable enough to walk in water or on a slippery surface. The side zipper is very easy to zip and makes putting on the boots that much easier. They are definitely true to size but are not too tight on my feet. I still had plenty of room to move my toes around. I am very impressed with these boots and will be purchasing many more pairs. I highly recommend this product.', 'This Time and Tru ankle zipper booties are really nice. They are simple but yet stylish with the outer side zipper. They look good with jeans, especially skinny jeans. I think they would be great with dresses and skirts too.', 'They have a light memory foam sole which for me is not enough, I need more cushion than that but it maybe perfectly good for someone else. Most shoes are not comfortable enough for me, I tend to have to add an insole in them.', 'They reach directly at my ankle. I have to wear them with socks otherwise they rub and scratches my ankle. They do look great with ankle socks.', 'I love the 1 inch heel which makes them easy to walk in. The rubber bottom means no slipping and sliding.', 'The wide width is great for my wide feet. It has lots of room, no squeezing my toes. They seem to be true to size.', ""I haven't worn these booties for a long time so I can't say how well they will do on my feet for hours."", 'Overall I am very happy with them.', ""I love the fit of this boots. The size I have is 7 1/2 wide, It is true to size. My feet are flat and wide and I can wear socks with these boots and they still make my feet look normal. The zipper on the side makes it easy to slide on and off. The slight heel makes this a comfortable walking boot. The style of the boot is today's fashion. These boots go with a number of outfits that I wear and can be dressed up or down.

It is simply Hanes Sport on the tag.    When Florida gets into the heat of the summer, I can judge this thicker material better.  So far it is working out OK.  My husband has the actual Cool Dri and you can feel the difference.  So I would still recommend this product if you don't mind the slightly thicker fabric.  It would be nice if there was a wider choice of lighter colors as well.  I purchased the light and dark blue.

How disappointing!"", 'Run small compare to other hanes Bra products, plus the shoulder strings which are the support; Did feel very rough for any kind of skin. i still have not used any of them nor I am planning to use them, I was trying to return them all, but Is been hard for me to find the place in the website to do so\n\nThanks', 'This bra is soft, well fitting and comfortable to wear. This is the 2nd of these bras tat i own and are my favorites.', 'Love these bras and they didnt have the aize I neesed in the store so I decided to order, which I will do from now on cause they are cheaper online and a bigger selection.', ""I have been buying this style of bra for several years, and this is the first time I have been anything but comfortable in one. The problem is the strap design.  The straps are no longer made of a stretchy, satin-ribbon type elastic with the raw ends tucked under.  Instead they are made of a stiff fabric that is sewn to a small amount of smooth elastic in the back.  The raw edges overlap around the top of the shoulder blade and irritate the skin. By the end of the day, I had sore areas on my collar bone, the top of my shoulders and my back where the elastic and bra fabrics overlap.  You don't notice this when you try the bra on in the store, but by the end of the day you can be miserable.  The straps are fabric wrapped with bias cut strips, which are then serged.  All of these layers are against your skin and can be very irritating.   Also, for some reason they moved the strap adjusters to the back so that you have to slip it off to guess what would be the right size, then try it on and repeat until you get it right.  I still love Hanes and plan to try their bras again when the strap design is changed.  Remember, dear Hanes, customers would rather pay a tiny bit more for quality than end up with something unwearable cluttering their closets."", ""Even at their longest, the straps are too short.  The cups are weird, kind of pointy.  I've had this bra for over a year and I've only worn it maybe four or five times.  It's very uncomfortable, and I find myself yanking at the band to try and pull it down all the time."", ""I've always had a problem with many of my bras, either the cup is too big too little or the waistband is too loose or tight. I figured let me try these because they looked very comfortable. I'm glad I did !! This is the best fitting bra for me. It's super comfortable, covers me entirely also love the shape it gives me with my shirts on. Will definitely buy me a few more. Thanks"", ""They are made well and fit as expected.  I wish they were made with a better fabric that could stand up to use.....because the only problem I have is that the fabric pills after wearing several times from rubbing against other clothing and body parts.  You have to carefully use a tiny scissors and carefully remove each pill.  You can't use a clothing shaver to remove as it will cause a hole in the fabric.  I always hand wash and dry so that's not the issue and I only wear them 2 times before wearing another one so with that - they are well cared for with my use.  They are comfortable to wear as well.  I've tried to add a photo as the option is there but it won't highlight so I can add one."", ""I am not enamored of the straps or the fact that I ordered a band size that should have been WAY bigger than the bras I already own, but, isn't. It is somewhat bigger, but .. I am guessing this company sizes the band to be exactly so when on the last hooks before the end, instead of the middle or other end, like more generous companies do. Also, the band has very little stretch as do the straps. Which could be a good or bad thing, depending on what you expect when you purchase them. For me, big shouldered and overweight, the straps at their loosest setting barely get over my shoulders and do what needs to be done.  All that being said, despite the straps and band being tighter and less giving than expected, I am sitting here  wearing a bra for the first time in weeks and feeling almost perfectly comfortable.  I'd be annoyed more if I hadn't gotten them so cheap, but for the price they are pretty darned nice! You'll pardon me for not adding photos!"", ""There is a plastic-like material used surrounding the area of the bra where the beat would test that is uncomfortably irritating to my skin. It feels as if a tag is poking my skin and unable to remove it. I should've tried one on before I bought five and now I regret it."", 'I had seen this in a store.  Better price online and went up a size which worked because of clasp at back.', 'This is a very comfortable bra without an underwire. It fits well.

But, it wouldn't be out of place if I threw a jacket on to go for a walk or to the store. Colors are nice. It is longer than I expected, but I think I also could have worn a size smaller, so that's probably why.  Which means it runs a little larger than the size chart says because the size I ordered should have been borderline too small and instead it is definitely too big by a size. Very stretchy except at armbands and neck it is less so. They are generously cut, though.  It's not a thrilling dress. The detail on the front looks more weird than fetching.

The top measurements, as measured with the top laying flat: bust, 18.5""; hip, 19.25""; center back to end of cuff, 31.5""; back length, 26"". The bottom is not straight across but has a nice curve. The pants, as laying flat, hip, 22""; inseam, 29.25; back crotch depth, 14""; overall length at side seam, including cuff, 39"". there is a dark blue ribbon tie at the waist for decorative purposes only. It\'s not a drawstring. I\'m only 5\'1"" and the pants came to my ankles. For someone with long legs, the bottoms would be too short. I washed and dried the set and all seams stayed intact. The bottoms are pink, dark blue, avocado green and ivory. The sherpa top is all ivory. This would make a comfy lounging set. I\'ll probably get a sweatshirt to pair with the bottoms, as I said, keep the top to wear like a sweater. Since I got the pj set in June, it\'s way too hot to wear it.

The bottoms were okay, the fit was as expected and they are made of soft 100% polyester. Fleecy feel, but not completely. They are thin, so not too hot. I would not necessarily call the pattern that I received 'tie dye', it's blue splotches, like camo, more than tie dye. The biggest issue I had with them is that they actually have little cuffs at the bottom, which is more like a child's pajama set than anything I've ever had as an adult. It was a little hard to get used to. The top was absolutely not what I was expecting. It's also 100% polyester, but it is as poofy as a cloud. I've had blankets like this before, but this was a full on sweater. My first impression after putting it on is that it would have been a lot cozier if it were bigger. It's not long at all and was a big snug, not as true to size as the pants. With some more room to move I might have enjoyed it better. I also know from experience that this type of super soft cushy fabric hangs really easily on everything, so I think anyone with any dry skin issues would be absolutely miserable wearing this, it will hang up and scrape any dry skin on your hands and upper body. I attached a picture of the inside of the shirt, it's not quite as poofy inside but has a lot of the same feel. The shirt also has the cuff on the end of the sleeves, keeping it tighter to your wrists without any flow. All in all with the size and features I did not feel cozy, I felt a little like I was trapped. I also fully admit that I have not tried to wash it as I have a strong feeling this top is going to shed this poofy stuff all over my washer and dryer.

The cups pull down for easy access without getting stretched out or losing shape on the neckline. I do wish I would have sized down. I purchased a large based on the size chart (38C for reference) and because of the stretch in the fabric it not quite as supportive as I was hoping. Ill wear this one around the house and buy a medium next time. I also was hoping the cups would have been molded into the bra and not removable.

I love wearing leggings. That is most of my pants in my closet. Because I wear leggings so much, I have become quite picky with the materials. Leggings I wear has to be soft, cannot be see through, for the summer ones, can't be too hot when I wear them and for winter ones, has to be able to keep me warm. I am trying out the Women's Plus Size High Waisted 2-Pack Fleece Lined Athleisure Leggings. First thing I noticed is that it is pretty thick, which means I probably cannot wear it during the summer seasons, but seems perfect for winter weather. It also feels really soft. It is lined with fleece which is probably why it is so soft. I am sure the thickness and softness will keep me warm and comfortable during the winter months. Another thing I really like is the quality of the material. I was able to really stretch the material, but it still cannot see through. I posted a photo of the pants really stretched out to show the quality of it. I tried it out and no doubt it was really soft, stretchy, comfortable and kept me really warm. I like that it is plain black so I can match with pretty much any color top. It works well with most occasions depending on the top I match it with which makes it so versatile."", 'These are the best leggings ever, especially for cold days! They are thick, and very very comfortable. I really like the high-waisted style because of my stomach area. I usually wear a large in leggings and these are 1X/2x and they fit perfectly. I assume they run somewhat small..which is ok by me! I will be buying these leggings!!', 'I wear a size 22-24 so I ordered the 3X. They do fit however, you have to put them on like pantyhose with the amount of compression these things have. They are warm enough for a Texas winter so far. They do show EVERY curve and bump and are great at sucking in the tummy some too.', 'Yes, I fit that stay at home mom stereotype. I live in leggings! With two small children I am busy all day every day. These are so easy to throw on and do house work or school drop off/pick up for my oldest. They also work for running errands. I also try to go running when I can arrange for someone to watch the baby. These are great for running in the chilly Fall weather. They are so warm and so comfy! They are also flattering to a mom with some extra baby weight still hanging around. I pair them with my favorite Fall cardigan and they are perfect. Also great for wearing under dresses in cool weather. I think they are mostly true to size but I would size up if in doubt. Definitely recommend and I will be getting more! They are a staple for me!', ""These leggings are so comfortable. With leggings they come in different textures. These leggings are lined. Making it comfortable to wear during the cold winter days. These leggings don't itch and they feel amazing. I would definitely recommend these leggings"", 'So I was pretty excited about these pants. I am all about high waisted pants and like that I can also turn down the extra tall part of the pants if I want to. I was very curious about the ‚Äúfleece lined‚Äù and how exactly that would work with leggings. But they are athleisure so I went with it. I was pleasantly surprised in that they were not fleece lined as I was thinking they might be- I thought there might be fuzzy type material inside that would make them super thick. I think my other leggings are much thinner but not so much that these were too thick. They were like one more layer of super thick tights; definitely thicker than most leggings but not so thick you would feel like you are wearing pajama pants. And, of course, the value is amazing and two packs are always amazing. I strongly suggest you err on the side of getting a bigger size- they most certainly run a little small size wise. In fact, the drawbacks or negatives for these leggings were that they are a little hard to get on due to the thickness (again, think of very thick tights) and they were not roomy enough (for me) in the seat. Everywhere else was fine (thighs, lower legs, tummy)- but the bum was a little too tight for me. I do like these but do suggest ordering on the bigger side for your size.', ""I was a little concerned that these fleece leggings would not fit me, despite getting the correct size. Although they were rather tricky to get them precisely placed, once they were on, they are extremely comfortable. To explain what I mean, the groin region was the area I had problems with. It was almost like trying to get into a really tight fitting pair of jeans. But in order to not have a lot of unflattering space between my groin and thighs, it did require a bit of wiggling and pulling to get these leggings where they needed to be. These are extremely form fitting leggings, so I know that I will only be wearing these around the house or under clothing. I honestly feel like these would be the perfect leggings to wear under clothing to join the kids outside in the snow this winter. I love the high waist which measures approximately 3 inches. Also, I love the fact that these come with 2 in a pack and the colors look phenomenal. Unlike some other legging brands I've bought in the past, these leggings are not see through and revealing. Although I would not feel comfortable enough going shopping with these on, I feel like they are perfect for a relaxing day at home, and I would easily wear these outside to walk the dog, or to grab the mail, etc. I love how soft and warm these leggings are and they seem to wash well and are holding up nicely so far. Overall, I would recommend these to anyone that stays cold, like myself. I think these would be perfect to wear under clothing to help keep you warm on the colder days. I would recommend these to others, but keep in mind, they can be tricky to get on and are a little to tight for this mom of 4 to feel comfortable wearing out in public."", 'These leggings are really great quality. I love the thickness of them. Theres 2 leggings in the pack, mine had one grey one black. They are 95% polyester and 5% spandex. After washing and drying them they showed no signs of wear and still looked like new. The only problem i have is the size run small. It says the size is 2x/3x but its not. Its probably a large. Other than that, these are very well made high quality leggings and i would definitely recommend them in the right size. The thickness and quality is really amazing.', ""I received these Women's Plus Size High Waisted 2-Pack Fleece Lined Athleisure Leggings."", ""I have to start by saying how extremely soft and comfy these are. I also love the high waisted thick band at the top. I wear these with the waist band folded down like yoga pants. The fleece lining is so soft and comfy against my skin and so soooo warm. These will be a favorite this Winter for me. The length is great but the sizing runs very small compared to most other brands. I usually wear a size med/large or a sz 12 in pants/leggings....these fit perfectly and these are sized at a 2x/3x. There's a huge difference in sizing. I don't mind but anyone who is looking for a size true to a 2x/3x, would be very disappointed because these run so small."", 'Overall, I would recommend these but would really suggest double checking on size.', ""I recently received the ‚ÄúWomen's Plus Size High Waisted 2-Pack Fleece Lined Athleisure Leggings‚Äù in the 2X/3X size. I picked these leggings specifically for my mom because she has recently decided to start walking in the mornings with me. As soon as I took these leggings out of the packaging I thought there was no way these leggings would fit my mom. I usually wear a size small/medium in leggings so I tried this 2X/3X sized legging on and it fit me perfectly. I didn't want to embarrass my mom by having her try these on and them not fitting so I asked my husband who wears a 38 x 29 size pants and they fit him pretty tight. I do have to admit that he was able to get them on and off but it wasn't really that comfortable. I do give these leggings extra points for being able to fit different sized bodies but that is a wide range of sizes to cover. I'm kind of interested to see how the size small/medium would fit me now. I did like the really high 3 inch waist because it really holds in that mama pouch that a lot of us women have. The fleece lining on the inside was super soft and really warm and just all-around felt great in the chilly weather. I also love the fact that these leggings come in a two pack."", 'These leggings are great! They are soft and fit true to size. They have a large band of material that is high waisted to help with tummy bulge. What I really like about them is that they are long enough to reach the top of my tennis shoes.', ""They are very warm.. And they fit great. The 2xl are very snug. But I will wear them. I was surprised to see that there was no seams in back or front and on sides. I would have rather had scenes in the front and back that's why I give it a four. But yes I would buy again if they had different colors. Would like a pair of hunter green."", ""I am 5'8‚Äù 300 lbs, I wear a 20-22 in pants and got the 2x/3x. I can put them on and they stay on but it takes some finagling to get them on and they fit weird in the crotch. They are comfortable and thick and I will still wear them but won't order more. Also love that they are actually high waist, even with my belly in the way."", ""Run on the small size. In fact, I didn't think they would fit. They did, but I had to work at getting them on. I already know that I better not put in dryer. They are warm and fit like a second skin."", ""Bought a size larger than I normally wear and I couldn't even get these up my legs.  I have already returned them.  They are not the kind of leggings I was expecting."", 'I ordered my normal plus size, 2X/3X. These are described as plus size. They look like they might fit someone who wears a normal size medium or large. Frustrating and a waste of money.', 'The size was misrepresented. They are much smaller than a 2x-3x. Ever worse they stink and washing didnt get rid of the smell. It is like machine oil or something chemical and I will probably send them back.', ""The material was very nice. That layer of warmth will be appreciated in cooler weather! Size wise, great for a 2x, could be tricky for a 3x, especially if you're ample in the thigh area."", ""These are perfect for this time of year when it's cold outside and you want to want a dress or a skirt."", 'I purchased these for my sister who loves them.

Around my stomach is was a tad uncomfortable, not sure entirely if it was suppose to kinda minimize the look of my stomach, which is kinda did but I had to make sure to wear a long shirt to cover it or else it looked kinda weird and it felt slightly tight when I sat so ended up pushing down to my waist a bit.

I like that it's sleeveless and thin enough to wear in the summer but at the same time, not so thin that you cannot wear it during the fall and winter. I washed it in cold water according to the label and dried it on low, however being only 55% cotton I should have realized it was going to shrink a little. Now it only shrunk a tad but it's noticeable. I strongly suggest you wash it on cold and line dry it because with the other 45% being polyester it shouldn't need ironing and by not putting it in the dryer it won't shrink.

This shirt has a rounded neck and short sleeves and seems like a very nice and breathable material. It is thicker and nicer than I would have expected from a basic tshirt type.

The shirt is an easy-care, machine washable, cotton/polyester blend that you can either line dry or put in the dryer. It doesn\'t easily wrinkle and has needed no ironing. It is label-free which eliminates any itchy discomfort. The fabric is slightly stretchy which allows it to be an excellent fit. I am a petite and and T-shirts are often too baggy even in a size small - not so with this one! It fits better than many others I have tried. The T-shirt is blue sapphire heather which is a great color to wear with many items. It blends-in well with darker denim: nice for the daytime and perfect to dress-up with summer sandals, some jewelry and a light jacket for a casual summer dinner or outing.

It's not too long but long enough that it doesn't ride up in the back when I bend over. I've washed it a couple of times and it held up very well. No wrinkles or seams gone twisty.

You can wear it casually with shorts or jean, wear it to work under a blazer or with a skirt, and even sport the t-shirt on a night out on the town by accessorizing jewelry. Either way you go, this t-shirt has you covered. I do highly recommend."", ""The beautiful blue sapphire color is like a dark denim, and will go nice with pants, shorts, and skirts. The small size 4-6 was a little big on me (pictured), but still quite soft, and comfortable. My daughter will be wearing this for work, and out with friends, as it fits her much better. She likes it a lot, and said it was nice and soft, with a slightly loose, but relaxed fabric fit, so the small runs a little big, because she is about 130. There are no tags, which is great, and the size and washing instructions are printed on neck of fabric. I hand washed to save on electricity using machine, and water turned slightly blue from dyes, so that's probably why washing instructions say to wash in cold water, with like colors only. If you need to bleach, use non chlorine only, and tumble dry low (or hang outside on clothesline like we do). There weren't many noticeable wrinkles, but if you need to use iron, keep it on warm. The material is thin but not too see through. I would definitely recommend for only $4.88, but you can save $1.26, by getting the 2 pack bundle for only $8.50. Last I looked, the 2 pack doesn't offer all the same pretty colors buying separately, but some. I'd like to get more in the purple, black, brown, and sea turtle colors, if they made an extra small, but for now the sizes come in small to extra extra extra large. Made in El Salvador! :-)"", 'This is a really great basic t-shirt. I have never tried a t-shirt in this brand so I didn‚Äôt t really know what to expect. The quality of this shirt is very nice. People wouldn‚Äôt know it was from Walmart unless you told them! The shirt is a pretty shade of blue. The thickness of the shirt is a nice quality and thick but not to thick to wear in the summer. So far it has held up well in the wash. I washed with like items and it came out without any piling. This shirt can be dressed up or worn with jeans or shorts. Just add a nice necklace, slacks and heels and you are set for work. This shirt does have a high neckline. I personally like that about this shirt. I would recommend this to a friend and will probably buy this is other colors! It also fits true to size. I got this in a small and that is my isual shirt size and it fit well.

Mainly, I was expecting to get the nice feeling shirts like before that are typically NOT see through and that feel good on your skin. Also, these are SHORTER in the body than normal... so again, that cheapens it. The sleeves are nice and long. The stitching is good.

I am only 5 feet and the dress comes down to my ankles, but I actually like that it is longer on me. The color is nice and the pattern on it is very elegant.

I was worried it would be too long for me (I\'m fairly short, at 5\'3""ish) but it\'s wonderful. If I had to make a complaint, and this is so super minor, it would be that one of the buttons to fasten the dress is directly under my left breast so it\'s hard to see and therefore fasten.

Being a bit older, it's also important to have room in the waist. :) I have just one issue with the 18W Tall jeans I bought - they don't come with the comfort waistband that they used to. I have 18W Tall jeans I purchased last year, and they have a wide black-on-the-inside waistband with sayings like You are Strong. You are Talented. I don't really need the platitudes, but I DO need that 'comfort waistband.' Please bring it back. One more thing - the dark jeans are SUPER dark. Be aware of that when you order."", ""I haven't bought a pair of Lee Jeans for ages, as I live in Arizona and it's usually too hot for jeans. But these are a good lightweight jeans for winter here. The fit is great and I like the soft stretch fabric. Definitely getting another pair soon!"", 'I was and am so disappointed with these jeans. I\'ve been buying these jeans for about 6 years now and have several pair of the ""OLD"" Relaxed Fit. This time I got the ""New"" Relaxed fit thinking by ""New"" they meant better!! I could never be more wrong!! These are not even the same color. They are very thin and the dye job is awful, making them appear as though they have stripes across the area between the waist and hip area. I took a pic of both side by side. The pair on the left are about 3 years old and have been through the washer close to 100 times, the pair on the right have been washed once and were purchase back in August. They are supposed to be the same color but are far from being anything close. I would have sent them back but needed a pair of jeans for a certain occasion and didn\'t have enough time to wait. (Since my shirt was going to cover the stripes, I didn\'t let them bother me.) One of my main reasons for buying the old ""Relaxed Fit"" was because I have severe psoriasis covering both legs and Lee ""Old"" Relaxed Fit in Tall are the only pants that don\'t irritate my skin. I can hardly wait for the Old Relaxed Jeans to come back in 2017...I\'ll be checking in often and will definitely stock up this time!!!', 'This is the second pair I have bought for work and I love them ...they give me the comfort I need to bend stretch etc at work.', ""I liked the fit through the hip and legs, but the pants run big in the waist. I had to make the waist smaller by running elastic through the waist band. Wish jean makers wouldn't always make the waist so big. Women are not made straight up and down."", 'I always order tall length.  The length is a little bit shorter on these than my other Lee jeans.  They will do, but just wish they were about an inch longer. Otherwise, I like them.', ""I was afraid to order jeans online, but since Covid, I don't go in the stores and try on cloths. I ordered my usual size. I'm 5'-9‚Äù so i selected the long version (better longer than too short). I was happy i did! They fit very well. They are comfortable jeans and very good quality. I've already purchased another pair!"", 'Love these jeans! Fabric is a light weight denim  with a wonderful amount of stretch built in. I am 5ft 4 in and this is the perfect length. I loved the jeans so much that I ordered another!', ""Love these jeans! Full enough to fit my full hips, yet not have the usual 4‚Äù gap in the waist! Perfect fit, and great comfortable feel! Finally, a pair of jeans I don't have to alter before I can wear them! : )"", ""I've been buying Lee Jeans for over 10 years. From the first time I tried on Lee Jeans and purchased them to now, I have always been happy with the fit and cut. Also, the length is perfect.... and they never shrink and shorten up over time. I currently wear a plus size, but if I ever get back to women's sizes, I will still wear Lees. Regardless of what size I may be, I know that these jeans will always fit my waist and curvy hips just right."", 'I love how these fit my curves without too much fabric, I have had plus size jeans that worked but seemed to always have a bunch of extra fabric in the areas of the curves such as the stomach area. Lee found nice material that is not too thick or too thin with just enough stretch to fit my curves and flatter my shape. The material colors are classy and trendy. I found the recommended sizes to be too big, so I must not know how to measure myself but with free shipping both ways it was convenient to send back the wrong size. The price alerts are great as I will buy more in a smaller size for summer when the price drops again, I need bigger size for winter so I can wear long johns underneath. I like the straigh leg as I am tired of the skinny jean-sometimes too restricting, as well as the boot cut-sometimes too baggy and drafty on my legs in the winter.', 'I have been a Lee customer for many years. I work in a business casual environment, so black jeans are allowed. I where them every day (with different tops of course), but at one point, Lee stopped making the black jeans that I have been buying for years and years. I was so disappointed. But finally, they have returned and I have stocked up on them. What do I love the most about these jeans? Two things; one is that they come in a longer length (not talls, but longer 33"") and the second thing is, the belt loops. Yup! I said belt loops. They are place strategically and generously around the waist so your belt stays in place. I still have 9 more years to work, and I\'m begging Lee to NEVER get rid of these jeans again. I simply LOVE them!', 'I love these jeans because they come in long plus they have a little stretch in them and will not bust at the seams. They look good & come in a few colors. I get a little upset about the price; but, all in all, the jeans are very good product & wash well.']","['Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 494 ratings , based on 494 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 494 ratings , based on 494 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 494 ratings , based on 494 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 494 ratings , based on 494 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 494 ratings , based on 494 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 494 ratings , based on 494 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 494 ratings , based on 494 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 4.0 ) out of 5 stars 494 ratings , based on 494 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 4.0 ) out of 5 stars 494 ratings , based on 494 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 3.0 ) out of 5 stars 494 ratings , based on 494 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 494 ratings , based on 494 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 4.0 ) out of 5 stars 494 ratings , based on 494 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 4.0 ) out of 5 stars 494 ratings , based on 494 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 494 ratings , based on 494 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 494 ratings , based on 494 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 494 ratings , based on 494 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 494 ratings , based on 494 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 4.0 ) out of 5 stars 494 ratings , based on 494 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 494 ratings , based on 494 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 494 ratings , based on 494 reviews']"

This really does compare to shirts I had to purchase for a professional firm that required business uniforms on certain days, and I ordered those shirts from a famous and somewhat expensive catalog company. One thing this shirt has that those do not, is an invisible hooter hider snap in the button placket, right where a large bust would stretch open the placket. Love that. The fabric is NOT at all cotton-y, and it feels a little like windbreaker material, so it would probably not be good for business formal attire, but business dress and business casual would be just fine.

Both now have 4 hooks for my size where as my sized use to have 3.  I feel like I'm wearing a  corest with all this extra fabric and hooks.  With this bra, the cup had too much material and so there were wrinkles in it that showed through my top.  The other bra, obviously the same size, did not do that.  My size hasn't changed since I was 13.  The cup also shaped my breasts in an odd manner, kind of like bullets and the points pointed outwards, to the side.  The result wasn't at all like the photo.

The leg of the leggings was stretchy and comfortable and I probably would've rated these 5 stars if it wasn't for the odd fit of the waistband.

I'm currently searching for another Playtex bra."", 'This is my second purchase and this one is better than the first. The bra runs a little big in the cups. I ordered a size smaller and it fits better. The quality of the first bras I ordered was poor. One of the seams fell apart after wearing it once.

It\'s not major & these do hold up very well when going through any number of washings. I keep enough in my wardrobe to wear one a day & I have some that are more than a year old that are wonderfully soft on the skin but still look almost brand new.

They are both big gals & they love them as much as I do because they stay in place no matter how long you wear them or how active you are.\n\nDon\'t EVER take these off the shelves, Hanes!!!

When panties from the same package are compared to each other there may be anywhere from half an inch to one and a quarter inch difference in their waist size!

It was 41 degrees out; I wore the black one under a thin blouse and I only added a running jacket. I was perfectly warm. After being washed, there is no pilling.

I only need this for sleeping when it is really cold outside, mid winter use. But for relaxing days it is nice to wear and you can still get things done, the sleeves can be pushed up and they will stay there so they don't get in the way when you need to do something. That makes it a versatile t-shirt that can be used for more than a night shirt. It is only for a top pajama use it is not long enough to be a one piece wear, but the colors available are complimentary to anything."", 'It is a good brand name and their products are long lasting and still hold their shape for many years.

They are a poly/cotton blend so they wash up well, I do not put in the the dryer. The round neckline is comfortable not too tightening around the neck area, the v-neck not to low. The v-neck runs a bit larger in the chest, which I prefer. The black small measures 34"" in the chest seam to seam, the white v-nec measures 36"". The size small fits a 4-6.

A must have in your closet for diversity and texture. They offer rich colors and are true to the color shown. So, so soft and waffle breathable material. They use 80% recycled polyester and 20% cotton. Every stitch neatly in place. They are made well. The cuffs are ribbed and do keep the cold out. The reason for 4 stars is for the size. They run small in size. I got the next size up and perfect ....for me. The material is kind of thin and also a little sheer depending on your taste. I can accessorize and make what I have look like more wearing these thermals. I can wear them under a nice blazer or vest! The colors and texture pop! Or wear alone with a nice scarf and a pair of jeans, casual look. It makes it easy to adjust to any body temperature. Dress them up or down. Easy care wash, cold. Tumble dry on low.', 'These two shirts are very comfortable. It was very nice to get two of them. My daughter really liked them, especially the red one. The sleeves were nice and long so they would even cover your hands if it was very cold out. The shirts are well made. There were no strings hanging and the seams are durable.', 'I like these shirts and they can be worn in a variety of ways. They can be worn as a base layer in cold climates. Also, the shirts have a v-neck which makes them look good to wear alone. They do not look like longjohns! Another option is to wear as pajama tops. They are soft and comfortable so you will feel cosy all night. Fruit os the Loom is a respectable company and I feel confident in their products.', 'Upon first appearance these thermals look thin and light weight, they were thin enough to see light pass through them After wearing them found them to be much warmer then they appear. The colors are very nice and work with my wardrobe very well. For the most part I was impressed with them. The texture was that which you would expect of thermals but they are soft and comfortable. I am a bit concerned with the quality, one of the shirts had a small hole in it when we got it. The hole has not gotten bigger nor have any more holes appeared at this time. All in all a very good product that I would buy again. Additional colors and if the material would be great, and a slightly heavier material might be nice for extreme weather conditions', '.', ""I received this product as a member of the walmart spark reviewer program. It is getting very cold (and will likely get colder) so i got these forms wife who really likes them as they are very comfortable. The only caveat is that these thermals are a bit baggy on the arm length so it gets annoying when its worn as an undergarment. The material is soft but the strechyness doesn't seem like it will stand the test of time from slacking especially around the v-neck. Time will tell. The main reason i recommend this thermal is the it keeps you very warm and they come in very nice colors."", ""The fruit of the loom thermal tops Fit for Me arrived by UPS. They was delivered in a nice thick smaller brown cardboard shipping box. There were two thermal tops that were placed in a clear plastic wrapping that was taped closed for transport.

The gray colored top has a crew neckline. The are no tags sewn in with these fruit of the loom thermal tops that can poke or annoy the back of the neck. All of the information about the thermal tops are manufactured stamped inside during production, which is located on the back of the neckline.

The fabric is not scratchy it flows on the body and doesn't get stretched out. The fabric is produced and sewn together tightly so it will not snag and fall apart. When washing use the gentle cycle do not add fabric softener in the washing machine and the low heat in the dryer this helps to keep there shape. They are loose fitting not tight, lightweight and long enough to cover the mid section to the thighs. There is no flap in the back. Both of the thermals are double stitched on the collar and has some stretch for comfort and it doesn't bind around the neck. There are no buttons or snaps to make wearing the tops uncomfortable. These thermal tops trap more body heat and makes it ideal to wear during the cold winter months. Fruit of the loom offers all different types of thermals for the entire family. Fruit of the loom thermals are made in El Salvador."", ""I thought 4XL would plenty big enough but it's pretty tight and if it shrinks during a wash, I probably won't be able to wear them. I like the fact they're made from old plastic bottles and I would buy more items recycled like this. The tops are soft and if not for the tight fit , they would be perfect. Most items I get or 3XL or 4XL so you might want to order a size up on these."", ""ok so I got my Fit For Me by Fruit of the Loom Women's Plus Waffle Thermal Lounge Crew & V-Neck Top - 2 Pack yesterday.

I was comfortable wearing it. The neck line on both the round neck and v-neck was not tight and fit well around the wrist and did not cover the hand, It stayed in place . The length is long enough so I didn't have to keep pulling it down. The thermal shirt was smooth under my clothing so it didn't even look as if I had it on. The stitching on the buttom is thin and when I had them worn inside my pants it was not bulky. I washed them and they didn't stretch out of place. It stayed like new . I even wore it as a longing shirt and had no problems. The spandex feel of the shirt stretched and moved along with me. I liked the selection of colors available. I think it's a great soft to the touch, warm, lightweight thermal and would recommend to family and friends. I give it 5 stars out of 5 stars."", 'I was really surprised when I washed this shirt that it did not shrink. I have never had a thermal shirt that did not shrink. This is really cool! And it is very soft. It feels really good against your skin.', 'The material is a little thinner than I thought that it would be. I think that could be because it is made of 74 % Polyester and 26% Cotton. That is probably why it did not shrink too. I was still warm in it. I wore it under another shirt and was warm all day. I did not get over heated when I was doing things while wearing it either. It kept me just right in temperature.', 'I did not give it five stars because I did have a problem with the shirt riding up. I tried tucking it in my pants to see if that would help it stay in place. But it did still ride up some. I did not like the feeling of it getting higher on my neck.', 'The body of the shirt could be a little longer. I felt like it was not as long as some shirts of this type. But the sleeves are a really good length. I really likes this. I was able to stretch my arm out in front of me and the cuff of the shirt stayed at my wrist.', 'I like that the package has two shirts in it. And that the package has two different types of shirts.

Very warming and a great combination of 74% Polyester and 26% Cotton, Very stylish and she has the gray crew neck and a burgundy V-neck and both look really good. Made in El Salvador for or by Fruit of the Loom.', ""She always orders clothes online just a little bigger size than normal so they for sure fit and these tops are pretty close to a perfect fit by being ordered just a size larger than her normal. Might be good to know if ordering at Walmart.com . She also mentioned you really don't want a super tight fitting lounging undershirt in most cases, and heaven knows she is always right! She is very happy with these and you know the adage: Happy wife, happy life!"", 'I have been buying fruit of the Loom clothing for years. It was always a brand I could trust for quality and durability. That is until now!! These thermal shirts are scratchy and improperly sized. The long sleeves are so long they need to be rolled up.
