I was quite surprised by the fit of this thermal shirt. I\'m 6\'3"" tall, 200 pounds and this shirt is a large but it fits very well. Sure I don\'t have the body to model this shirt so you\'ll have to forgive me for the photos. I have long arms and these sleeves fit great and the tail is cut square and is long enough to wear out or to tuck in and when you bend over it doesn\'t crawl up your back, it stays put and doesn\'t expose your backside. It has 3 buttons at the neck and looks good enough on its own if you want to wear it as a shirt. I would like to tell you that it will keep you nice and warm in cold weather but we\'re still over 100 degrees here in Arizona so it\'s tough to tell you just how well it will work when it\'s cold.', ""The selling point of this shirt is that it's a Henley. The three-button front makes it a presentable baselayer and not another ugly generic undershirt you want to keep hidden. The grey coloring is light and the not typical dark grey. The shirt is made up of 54% percent cotton and 46% percent that combines to make a soft and comfortable wear—see attached photo of label. Right now, here in Florida, it's the middle of summer, so it's impossible for me to accurately say if this'll keep you warm in the middle of an Arctic winter. Instead, I can say this shirt is comfortable, stylish, and cool enough to be worn indoors—Thank you air conditioning! —during the warm summer Florida months. My only complaint would be that it has a generous cut. I received a size Large, my normal size, yet it fits loosely. If used as a baselayer it should have a tighter fit, so perhaps consider this when ordering."", ""This is my review of the Fruit of the Loom Men's Classic Waffle Thermal Henley Shirt. I usually wear these shirts during the winter months, under another shirt. This time of year I will wear it as my only shirt, because they look very nice. They are completely warm to wear as a only shirt when the weather starts to get cool and can handle the very cold weather under another shirt and coat when real winter sets in. Fruit of the Loom Men's Classic are always a great quality material and fit nicely. One thing about Thermal clothing you want it to fit well. The quality of Fruit of the Loom has always been good and they continue to hold up while other makers of thermal clothing are starting to be less good in their final made quality. The sleeves fit nice and are the correct length and the buttons do not pop off after a couple of washes. I have the grey, but have purchased the black and dark blue previously. They all have maintained their quality and color appearance over the years. Just a nice addition to your causal wear and a get addition to your layer when the weather is freezing outside. Would recommend this shirt."", 'This is a very soft shirt warm but not hot it breathes very well for maximum comfort it is stylish as well as serving as a undergarment or could be used as a pajama top it is very well constructed color gives many options as to purpose would recommend too anyone I suppose a woman might wear if dressed in the right clothes.', 'August may be the wrong month for thermal underwear but you do have to plan for the cold days ahead. This top fits well and would stretch comfortably for a larger person. The sleeves are cuffed and the neck has three large buttons. It is lightweight and would allow for layering with a tee shirt. I anticipate wearing this top with a flannel shirt, left unbuttoned. In the cold it should provide the heat you need and once inside you could remove the flannel shirt and still loo presentable in a casual way. This top does not look like underwear.', ""Great thermal shirt by Fruit of the Loom. Not bulky and cumbersome as others have been. Lightweight and comfortable. Doesn't bind at the neckline. From shoulders to wrist bands perfect. Set around chest and midriff are great. Pleasantly surprised. Easy maintenance and upkeep. Weather warren plain or with a shirt over it provides a great look. Easy to tuck in and stay in place. Now that's a perk. You just couldn't ask for better. Made by a company who you can trust. Quality. Timeless piece of clothing material."", ""I received the Fruit of the Loom Men's Classic Waffle Thermal Henley Shirt to give my honest opinion. But I have had the same thermal shirt for a couple of years now, and unfortunately, it's all worn out. So, when I came across this offer, I knew I had to take advantage of it. I'm about 5'7-5'8 and about 125-135 pounds; I must admit size medium fits me precisely. Some of the things I like about the Fruit of the Loom Men's Classic Waffle Thermal Henley Shirt is that it is machine washable, retains heat, cotton-rich fabric and its stretchable. One of the unique qualities of this thermal Henley shirt is it is built for the winter. Even though, it is not an expensive puffer jacket; don't get carried away because the Fruit of the Loom Men's Classic Waffle Thermal Henley Shirt can retain heat. Because it can retain heat, I noticed whenever I wear a thermal under my thin sweater during winter, I am kept warm throughout the day. But to conclude, I am a fan of the Fruit of the Loom brand and would recommend the Fruit of the Loom Men's Classic Waffle Thermal Henley Shirt to anyone who wants to stay warm during the winter months at an affordable price."", ""This review is for a Fruit of the Loom Men's Classic Waffle Thermal Henley Shirt. This shirt is lightweight yet strong enough to stretch with you and the three button henley option keeps me from feeling choked. The shirts are more polyester than cotton but still shrink some after washing and drying so make your size choices accordingly. The waffling of the material is what keeps you warm all the while wicking moisture away from your skin which also aids in staying warm. I do like the elastic cuff on each arm that aids in keeping the sleeve from wadding up around your elbows. The only complaint that I have is the length. I'm 6' 3”, 200 lbs and they are a little short for my particular situation. There are ample color choices for me as these are normally worn under another shirt so huge color choices are not as important to me as is warmth and comfort. I think one of my favorite features is the tagless technology. No more scratching on the back of my neck. I can physically see the tag that appears to be printed on the inside but never bleeds through so it's not visible from the outside of the shirt. I recommend these shirts if you need to stay warm and dry."", 'Nice fall/early spring thermal layer. Not too thick, not too lightweight. Length on large seemed a little shorter than I would like, while the arms seemed baggy. Washing it in warm water seemed to shrink the arms more than the length so it ended up working out well. Ends did not fray after wash like some other thermals I have owned.', ""The shirt is decent quality, though personally I'd prefer something a bit softer with a better fit. Perhaps it's the freedom that I like from wearing short sleeved tees, but the thermal shirt does fit snugly and would definitely keep me warm during those cold evenings (though this being the summer months, it's still be pretty warm out). I like the waffle pattern and overall feel, but the fit for some reason feels just a tad unnatural (most likely my personal body build). All in all, the three buttons in front are nice and it's a good shirt."", ""This shirt looks great, but the size is a bit inaccurate compared to most of my clothes as it fits a big too snug. I normally wear large shirts whereas this shirt would probably fit better in extra large. The The fabric is also bit rough the to point that I might want to wear a softer t-shirt underneath this. I can't judge how much protection it gives against cold weather because it 100 degrees here."", ""Fruit of the Loom Men's Classic Waffle Thermal Henley Shirt fits well. Fits nice without any trouble to the skin, very soft and easy fit. Maintains temperature and would be a great addition to winter wear. This is a great combo to go along with any full or half shirts during winter. Men would love to wear this under their shirts or T'shirts."", 'Living in Minnesota the winters get quite cold.

I like the price also.', 'I normally use ordinary Fruit of the Loom T shirts and am quite happy with those. This T Shirt works as a shirt by itself( I think because of the style and color) or an undershirt for the cold winters.', 'Out of the package it has a strong smell so I have to wash before I can wear.

I will be heading back to look for this Henley Shirt and see what color options are available for this upcoming winter...."", 'This being a Fruit of the Loom item, I knew this was going to be a quality product, but upon wearing it, it was so tight on me because this was a"" medium ""size shirt. I was suppose to have received a large, but I receive a medium and it\'s so tight on me, I gave it to my wife to wear and she like\'s it. The shirt material is thin, and can almost see through it, and I know the first time washing it, it will shrink, so those who are thinking about purchasing this item make sure it\'s a extra size up or more. I truly like this item but I deduct a star for the sizing of the shirt. (If I wear a large, I would go up to a ""extra large""). I do like wearing thermal\'s during the fall and winter months and this being a ""henley"" style shirt you could wear to any indoor/outdoor event while looking good and staying warm at the same time. Made in El Salvador, with 65% polyester and 35% cotton.', 'This Fruit of the Loom thermal top is warm it is the original waffle type of long sleeve underwear .There are buttons on the front for ease of putting the top on .Very comfortable even with an outer shirt movement is smooth no thickness to stop me from doing my regular routine ,but very warming and insulated well . The black is nice even after a washing the color holds quite even no fading no pilling just nice thermal top . The sleeves are a nice length for my 34 “ arms no riding up too short . I can tuck the bottom in because the top is long enough or leave it out and it looks great .I wear thermals every winter to keep my joints warm so no arthritis starts ever .Mine are medium with a good sizing that neither shrinks or fades .I will buy more of this brand .Great name brand Fruit of the Loom equals quality as they have many years .', ""I have used the Fruit of the Loom brand Henley's for about 15 years and they have always kept me warm and have been durable. This material is very soft and looks like the mesh design has been reduced or tighten to a smaller pattern. I have one that I bought two years ago and did a side by side comparison. The collar has been increased to one inch from the three-quarters that my two year old top has. The stitching seems more robust in the neck area and on the back side of the button area. The button area seems to have widen slightly also, the waist area has also had a increase in stitching. The cuff area has seen a big increase in the cuff from slightly over two inches to over three inches on the new top. That should decrease the amount of arm slide from the top. I did try the top on and it did fit like a glove, after washing in cold and drying on low, I did not notice any shrinkage in the fit or any odd bunching from the material. The material is very comfortable on the skin."", ""The Fruit of the Loon Men's Classic Waffle Thermal Henley Shirt is the most comfortable thermal shirt I have ever worn. The waffle design is fantastic and it looks good, even though no one will be able to see it during the cold days, for it will be under a shirt and jacket.

I also wore them inside heavier socks with work and hiking boots. Used them alone with everyday shoes. Have done a lot of heavy action with these socks and am extremely satisfied with them. In fact, I will choose this type of sock from now on for both dress and every day usage after my repurposing. Beside the inline skating, I’ve taken many tens of thousands of hard steps with these socks. They are durable. Significantly, the smooth finish is great for preventing blisters – the most important feature. I will also use them for inline skating from now instead of the similar feeling expensive specialty socks. They may not last as long in that usage as the specialty socks, but after my experience, I feel they’ll work well. For lighter duty dress occasions, I figure they will last many years.

I do not own any of the big name brands so my review will be a comparison to the Starter shirt. The fabric of the Hanes is 100% polyester as is the Starter shirt however, the Hanes shirt seems to be slightly thicker and less see-thru. The Hanes shirt is more full cut and has a longer length while the Starter shirt has a slimmer cut. Workmanship seems comparable. I wear these shirts while playing table tennis and was able to saturate both shirts quite easily. The moisture wicking ability of the Hanes seems to be slightly better but neither shirt will keep you dry if you sweat a lot. However, both will dry faster than a 100% cotton t-shirt. Overall, I prefer the Hanes to the Starter shirt because the Hanes is slightly less expensive and the material seems to be slightly better quality.']","['Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 1725 ratings , based on 1725 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 1725 ratings , based on 1725 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 1725 ratings , based on 1725 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 1725 ratings , based on 1725 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 1725 ratings , based on 1725 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 1725 ratings , based on 1725 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 4.0 ) out of 5 stars 1725 ratings , based on 1725 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 4.0 ) out of 5 stars 1725 ratings , based on 1725 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 3.0 ) out of 5 stars 1725 ratings , based on 1725 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 3.0 ) out of 5 stars 1725 ratings , based on 1725 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 3.0 ) out of 5 stars 1725 ratings , based on 1725 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 2.0 ) out of 5 stars 1725 ratings , based on 1725 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 1.0 ) out of 5 stars 1725 ratings , based on 1725 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 3.0 ) out of 5 stars 1725 ratings , based on 1725 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 1725 ratings , based on 1725 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 1725 ratings , based on 1725 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 4.0 ) out of 5 stars 1725 ratings , based on 1725 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 1725 ratings , based on 1725 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 1725 ratings , based on 1725 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 4.0 ) out of 5 stars 1725 ratings , based on 1725 reviews']",men's clothing

(I actually prefer a top entrance cargo pocket, but these are very nice.) Both cargo pockets are 9 wide, and 8 deep. The pants are cotton AND polyester, with the outside being very tight and smooth, and the inside being the softer fleece. The outside has remained tight and smooth, but the inside being softer do seem to have small pieces of the material that does come out when I remove them at night. (They\'re still new and haven\'t been washed yet.) The bottoms of the pant legs are fully adjustable with bungee cords, but do leave the cord showing; but not a problem. Some people have stated that the inner waist cord isn\'t long enough; but I find it fits correctly with a ½ inch solid flat drawstring, and NOT the cheap thin type of rope material. It leaves more than enough to tie a very solid bow tie that stays INSIDE the pants, making a smooth finished look. If you are a medium build or have regular or thinner legs they\'ll fit without looking like balloon legs; giving a slimmer normal look. No they aren\'t slim cut, just normal and comfortable. They do make another pair having a looser fit, with topside cargo pockets for the same price. I have another pair of another pair that are cargo pants like these in fit, and weighted both separately. The Vibes in medium weighed 12 ounces, and my other pair (new) was lighter at 8 ounces. The Vibes just seem so much nicer quality.  I would recommend these pants for everyday wear because they\'re so well fitting and finished, or for a gym workout. I\'ve also ordered a second pair for ""backup"".', 'These pants arrived by FedEx on time, and fit exactly according to size. (You CAN check their measurements for sizing..med is 34 yo 36 inches.) Soft tight weave cotton exterior, polyester fleece interior. I like the waist cord being INSIDE so it doesn\'t show. Cord allows for tying without excessive slack for a better tailored look. The zippers on the cargo area aren\'t on the top, strong and well made, but sideways for a classier more finished look.  These items must be washed with warm water, gentle cycle, and dried with a lower heat setting or air dried. The length is proper, and sits on the shoe properly, but can be adjusted with the bungee cords. The can stick out and become tangled, so I tied them in a loop. One side had a top slot to pass through, the other didn\'t. Also I hate a baggy look around the top section, and fit REALLY nice and comfortable. I like that I can wear them for everyday  without looking like ""work out pants"". If you have a larger ""lower section"" and wide legs, I suggest their other model with the relaxed fit, and Velcro closures.  I\'m going to buy another pair because I\'m crazy, and want to have a back up pair in my closet. They\'re 60% cotton/40% polyester. GREATEST VALUE/QUALITY for the money.

After having it on for a few minutes, I started to become uncomfortably warm. With a normal tee shirt on, I did not feel warm, so the “thermal” part seems to be effective. The snug fit might be a plus, since you will probably wear this under another shirt in the winter. I think this will be useful when the temperatures are in the single digits or teens, and I need to go outside to shovel snow. Unless you are a thin build, you will probably opt for the large size.

I like the fabric! though the size is small for me or im not that fit.. but it feels comfortable! I work nights in the hospital as a nurse and wear this twice already with my scrubs on. It gives me enough warm and no need for me to wear jacket. I would highly recommend this, it is affordable and good quality!!!', ""This compression shirt is just what I was looking for. It fits snug enough to where it's not too tight but also tight enough to be comfortable. I use this for early morning running on the weekends to where it's cool so this shirt keeps me warm enough but not where it's uncomfortably hot. I have lost a lot of weight so all the loose skin stays in place when I'm running which makes it easier for me to run. I would recommend this compression shirt to anyone that is looking for a compression type fit. I will be buying more shirts for the rest of the week when I work out."", ""Didn't have my size in this Dry Compression T-Shirt, was about to pass it up when I realized the extra small shirt available would fit my wife who at 5 ft tall and 95 pounds would be considered petite."", ""We found the shirt to be well made, very smooth and flexible.

I believe I ordered a men's small (obviously there was some sort of error with review saying the XXXXL). I opened the package and it was a size small (which would have been great if not for the fact it was a WOMEN'S small. You could tell by the cut and the logo was a female. Ok now for the good...my wife says she loves it. Nice compression material that is not itchy after a half hour of wearing. Form fitting as expected and the perfect length (not showing too much but not long) for her height of 5'3” it falls right at the waist. I wonder what I got to do to get the correct size for me...taking a picture of the logo it says “Thermajane” not “Thermajohn”. This shirt gets 5 stars for material and style"", 'Great wicking action.

(Raglan fit).', 'Made in China', ""The stitching on this long sleeve compression shirt couldn't be better. All of the materials used are good quality. It has a tight fit, as it should, and locks in you body heat, but unlike thermal it also helps keep you cool when you work up a sweat. Because it has a tight fit, there is no bulk when wearing this underneath other clothing and it is very comfortable."", 'I went this long sleeve shirt to use with biking on days when the temperature is in between 50F to 65F degrees...not warm enough for short sleeves but not cold enough for more winter like performance clothing...this shirt fits that need perfectly.', ""I with the Navy color which works great on sunny days, you get the heat of the sun from the darker cooler but the shirt has great breath-ability so you don't feel over-heated."", ""During my work out, unlike other performance shirts I've used, this one does a great job of pulling sweat away from you skin so it helps you feel more comfortable in exercising."", ""Initially I was concerned being 6' 2” as I normally take XLT and the shirt is only offered as XL, generally I've run into problems with performance clothing being woefully undersized or completely wrong in sizing their shirts from S to XXL. Thankfully that is not the case and the shirt I got as an XL is plenty long enough in tail and sleeves for me at 6' 2” and whether you take XL or XLT I think this size on this shirt is correct and works for by regular and tall size needs...I'm guessing other sizes are correct as well."", ""In the past I would have given the shirt 5-stars, but I think after what has happen in 2020, consumers are much more concerned with where things are manufactured of which I am once such consumer...and I'll leave it at that."", ""I'm impressed by this Thermajohn compression T-shirt. I have other name brand compression shirts and this one ranks right up there in terms of quality and construction. The material is smooth and feels comfortable during workouts. I especially like the raglan sleeves since I'm usually bothered by stitching over my shoulders. I chose a size Large and it fits quite nicely – with just about as much tightness as in the model and with enough snugness to keep things from chaffing. I'm a thin 6 foot tall 150 pounds and I wear a 42R suit jacket. I'm not a body builder and prefer long sleeve for cycling and lighter colors for visibility. The light steel grey is nice and generic enough to blend in with a variety of clothing. I'll be purchasing another in Slate color now that I know how nice these are."", ""I got the Thermajohn Men Long Sleep Base Layer Cool Dry Compression T-Shirt for Athletic Workout and Running to try out since I enjoy going out on hikes, camping, and enjoying the outdoors. My wife said too bad it didn't come with a 6pack for the shapewear part which is supposed to make me look lean and mean. There are different color options but I went with a charcoal gray looking color because it can go with pretty much anything. The shirt wicked away the sweat from my day enjoying the outdoors and was soft and comfortable to wear for long day out of the house. I would recommend this for those working out in the gym, any sport that makes you break a sweat, or even work it is stylish and comfortable and depending on the work you do you may need a comfortable shirt to wick away your sweat. I got the long sleeve one but love it so much I am planning to get the t-shirt option as well for the summer. With so many options I would mind have a few options ready for me to use without having to wait for them to be laundered for the next wear."", 'I have multiple other brands of thermal layers and I like this one even better than the ""namebrand"" one that most people think of when they think about thermal layers. The material was soft, flexible, and definitely helped keep me warm. It fit well (I recommend using their size chart before you buy because I am in between a small and a medium for normal clothes but the small Thermajohn fit me perfectly). In my pictures, there is a square crease around the logo on the chest but it\'s just from the packaging, not a defect. Overall, this is now my favorite thermal layer out of all of the brands I have tried.', ""This is a great shirt. It's well made. The materials and workmanship are very good and it's very comfortable."", 'I just wore it for a few hours in the hot Florida sun doing some hard yard work. I am not sweaty at all. This is very unusual for me. The shirt wicked away an impressive amount of moisture.', 'I am not hot. Apparently the ventilation technology works very well also.', 'I do not smell at all so the anti-odor technology works very well.', ""The only thing that I want to warn you about is the sizing. I wear medium size cloths and that is the size that I ordered. I do not feel much compression with this shirt because I believe it is too large for me. There is a slight snugness around my neck but otherwize it's rather loose."", 'If you check the sizing chart (which I did not have when I ordered) I see that I should have ordered the ""X-Small"" for a 32 inch waist? What? That\'s just crazy. So it\'s a great shirt but order carefully.', ""I have often found that compression shirts are hit and miss when it comes to correct sizing. Many are made overseas and only fit teenie tiny people, yet are marked with American sizing. I was skeptical when ordering this Thermajohn Men's Long Sleeve Compression T-Shirt, as I looked up the brand and found that it was made in China. However, when I received this shirt I was more than pleasantly amazed. The Thermajohn shirt is well made, has four-way stretch that allows for freedom of movement no matter the activity. It is definitely moisture wicking material, since I am a heavy sweater when it comes to athletics, and the shirt seemed to pull the moisture away from my skin, and allowed my skin to stay fairly dry and cool. I ordered a size larger than I generally wear in sweats and athletic clothing, because I wanted a fairly tight fit, yet not one that strangled my body uncomfortably. I was very pleased with the size that I ordered, as there is a snugness to the shirt, yet allows my blood to keep pumping. I found one stitching defect in the shirt, where it appears one spool of thread ran out, and a new one was started. It appears that this was caught at the factory and corrected, yet left blue stitching instead of the grey (yet that's being really picky). Overall, the quality of the product is excellent and well worth the package marked $39.99 price. It appears to be long lasting and well manufactured. Great shirt!"", 'Comfortable, soft and keep cool feeling when running', 'My neighbors asked me if I lose weight recently. Actually, it is this Thermajohn T shirt makes me looks like a bit thinner. But I am glad they thought so.', 'This Thermajohn Men Long Sleeve Baselayer Cool Dry Compression T-Shirt is very comfortable. Now is spring time, and I run every day with this T shirt for about a week. I am living in a walking community, and during this covid-19 crisis, the street is almost empty. I run on sidewalks sometime on the road.', 'During first half of running, as outside temperature is around 50s, this Thermajohn T shirt keeps me warm. Even in windy days or some with some drizzle, I still feel very comfortable to run with Thermajohn long sleeve T shirt.', 'After warm up period, if I choose a hilly route that day, maybe just after 10 minutes of running, I already begin sweating. This Thermajohn long sleeve T shirt is very breathable, not sticky to my skin. It keeps my skin the dry feeling for most of the time.', 'It is good for gym too, if you like long sleeve. For me, I prefer short sleeve T shirt for gym.', 'Overall, it is a good T shirt for running, jogging and hiking.', 'the product is packaged so as to be displayed as a peg item. From a worker perspective if these items were grouped in threes, it would be much easier and faster to display.', 'And maybe that is the case.', 'I have never owned nor have I purchased any product such as this thermajohn long sleeve shirt.

I went to the website to do some research and better understand this item.', 'I really like and appreciate how easy it was to open the packaging to get to the product. It sure was nice not to struggle or find a scissors. Thank you. Very thoughtful.', 'Like all products which i have never worn, i always wash the item. I read the instructions and I did not encounter any problems whether with the washing or drying and the product never had a problem either.', ""This shirt is a very interesting product, I have never owned any garment that feels great and from my perspective, it is very easy for me to forget that I am wearing this shirt and at times I have to make a conscious effort and remind myself that I am wearing this shirt. And this shirt has such a wonderful feel, nothing like i have experienced before. All I can compare this shirt to is a cotton shirt and this shirt feels so much nicer than cotton. It is easy to fall asleep in this shirt and really not realizing that i am wearing the shirt. I have fallen asleep in other clothes many different times before and when I awoke, I really wish that I hadn't."", 'Very nice job with this garment as far as fit and feel.

Definitely well made but one thing that I wished is that it would stay on the high setting until adjusted by me and not over a certain amount of time adjusting down a level automatically. Not a big deal as you can just adjust it back to the high heat setting manually. I bought this originally because I wanted something to keep me warmer when play golf during the Fall months and the position of the battery pocket is more on the back left hip area which doesn't impede my golf swing.

It is heavier than I thought which is a great thing.  It isn't a thin fleece.  I haven't worn it yet as I just opened it.  The only suggestion I would make is to order a size up.  I would normally order a men's large but after owning the hoodie I was almost certain the fleece would run small too.  I ordered an XL and was very happy that I did.  I could have ordered the XXL and had a little extra room without it being too big.  I can't wait to put it to good use."", ""Works great, long lasting and looks nice. The battery is heavy, and it makes you feel a little off balance because it sits on your left side, but I understand why it needs to sit there.

Easy to use and love the fact that you can control the temp easily with just pressing a button. The color of grey is darker in person than on the picture, it is more of a charcoal grey. I have nerve pain which gets worse in the winter time and this helps immensely. Great product, I get asked about it all the time! \n\nFor sizing - I am a woman - 142lb, 34B, 29 waist and a men's small jacket fit me.

Two of my family members have one now as well after seeing and wearing mine. My sister has POTs disease and is cold all the time.

I also like to wear the heated gear under my coat and it keeps me really warm. (Especially good for hunting or shoveling the driveway).

It's thin and not bulky at all, but just as warm as a thicker coat. My son loves it! Highly recommend this one."", 'I was a bit confused by some of the reviews claiming this jacket runs small. I normally wear size 42 dress shirts and depending on particular jacket, can fall in the L or XL size. To be on the safe side, I ordered BOTH sizes . Large fits well if a bit tight. If this is to be your second layer on top of a T-shirt or light shirt, Large is the right size. If this is to be your third layer, on top of a sweater or hoodie, then you may want to go for an XL. In my case, I kept the L and returned the XL.', 'Bought this for my son to take on a backpacking trip at Philmont (New Mexico). We needed something packable, light and warm! This fit the bill perfect. We placed it in a small compression sack and packed it down to nothing. He said it was very warm and worked perfectly. He plans on using it during the year, he really likes the way it looks.', ""Ordering was very easy and shipping was very fast. This is easily my favorite jacket, it is super light and very warm when cold out. Even if it is a little warm out you don't bake in the jacket and you never feel the wind. I would definitely buy another jacket from them in the future. Great product at a great price!"", 'For the price, this jacket works well. Warm, surprisingly light. Full size zipper (as opposed to the fragile, small zipper on expensive options like patagonia). Childish and stupid brand name-just sayin.

Recommended."", 'I bought this for my son as he needed a light weight warm winter layer. It is perfect for the purpose and the bright blue around the collar gives it a little more zip than the standard puffer coat.

I bought the Green/Purple and its color is as shown. I got tricked into thinking they ran small so I ordered the next larger size but had to return it for the advertised size. I am 73 in Charlotte,NC weighing 220 at 6 feet and it is perfect. This is a packable jacket so if you live in Minnesota this would be good in addition to a heavy coat. The jacket is truly a Down jacket with 10% feathers with a sample enclosed as opposed to some other high price Down advertised jackets that are polyester filled. You would think I work for the company but no,I am retired and need to find value and quality in my purchases. I would definitely purchase this again', 'Preface: This is the first down jacket I have ever purchased, but I do own a down sleeping bag. I was interested in trying out a down jacket, but did not want to spend upwards of $200 for one until I had a chance to try one out. I decided to purchase this jacket instead of borrow a more expensive one from friends. At first a had some reservations. I am 6 foot tall and weigh 280 pounds. I was worried that the XXL would be too small for me. Also, I would have preferred a hooded jacket and would have gladly spent $50 instead of $30 for a hooded model.', ""The color of the jacket was exactly as advertised and XXl fit me well. It is a little snug, but I like the feeling of snug from this jacket. The outer shell is very lightweight and does a good job of repelling rain. Light rain drops ball up and roll down the material easily. While one should not where a down jacket in the rain, it is good to see that it can repel water and give one the opportunity to take it off before the outer material soaks through. The inner material does a very good job of insulating. I can feel the warmth starting to build moments after zipping the jacket up. The zippers work very well both on the pockets and the main zipper. They run smooth and do not catch on the material. The only negative thing I can say about the zipper is that my beard would catch on it if the zipper is not zipped all the way up, but that is a very minor problem. I am most impressed with how the jacket handles the wind. Once zipped up the jacket feels like a cocoon of warm air surrounding your torso. While the wind does blow against the jacket, it doesn't really pierce through it. I can feel the temperature inside the jacket drop slightly, but I do not feel the wind against my skin."", 'I wore the jacket for several afternoons while I did bus duty at my middle school. It did a great job keeping me warm. The very first day I wore it I got hit with some bird crap on the right shoulder. I spot cleaned the shoulder with some paper towel and a water. The stain came off readily. If they sell a hooded model, I will definitely buy another from this brand.', 'I bought this XXL jacket for outer layer - purposely oversized to wear a sweater and vest under - perfect !!! Only disappointment is inside pockets are NOT sewn at the bottom . A good surprise the color green is darker . I also purchased a XL aqua blue , Thank You !!!! Jim', ""I really like puffer 'jackets' and have bought several different makes over the last several years. I use them in place of sweaters because of their warmth and light weight. But the Rokka&Rolla is the best I've purchased so far. Good quality, low price, good fit, and, as you'd expect, light weight and provides excellent warmth. And I love the blue color."", 'My son received this jacket today. He\'s 5\'10"" 160lbs. A medium fit him perfectly. He says its very lightweight, soft and traps heat very well. Hes going to use it hiking and it gets 5 stars for now. We will update you on how it stood the test in the mountains.', ""This jacket arrived today , and it exceeds my expectations. Many of the reviews I read before buying it warned of poor sizing, workmanship, and backward zippers. I must be lucky, because the jacket seems like a GREAT buy. The main zipper is on the correct size for a man, the arms on my XL size are a perfect length (I wear a 35''� sleeve in dress shirts) and are finished with a nice band for the wrist area. The jacket is super light but reasonably fluffy. I bought it to wear beneath a shell parka for downhill skiing. The Malibu Blue color is really pleasant, and the XL size was perfect for me (6'4''� tall, 200 lbs). The stitching seems ok although, although time will tell if it holds up. On day one it looks fine."", ""One oddity: Inside the jacket there appears to be two side pockets. Interestingly, if you put your hand all the way down these ''œpockets''� your hands go right through the pockets to air. That is, the bottom, horizontal seam of each pocket is not sewn shut! Maybe they're not supposed to be pockets, but they sure look like inside pockets!"", ""Overall, I'm thrilled at the sizing, appearance, and cost of this garment. It will not compete with a name brand high-end puffer jacket made by a high-end outdoor clothing co. , but for the AMZ price it's a no-brainer for someone looking for reasonably good jacket at a bargain price. Lucky me''”good fit, decent overall quality, and great value."", ""Not going to lie, this is by far the best purchase I have made in 2020! This puffer jacket is really lightweight so it is perfect for everyday wear and extreme activities.  That jacket is very soft and breathable so that means you're able to layer it with hoodies/shirts underneath comfortably. Durability wise, I only had this for a couple weeks, but I wore it snowboarding a couple times and it held up perfectly fine.

When it arrived, I was somewhat doubtful. It was great material. But didn\'t seem like it would keep me warm in 0 degree weather and before 0 temps. But was I very happy to learn that this jacket is the warmest jacket I have ever had! All big names brands can\'t compare to the warmth of this jacket. Very lightweight but very warm. Love the detail. Love the soft feel. Love the jacket. Would recommend to anyone! Hands down best jacket ever!', ""This is an exceptional bargain to get this level of quality at this price point. This is the second coat I've purchased from Rokka&Rolla. The first purchase was for myself, once I realized how nice the quality is and how warm the coats are I decided it was gift worthy and gave one to my daughter for xmas. Super high quality product and company, very functional and WARM, fit's exactly as expected. 5 stars all the way, f***ing nailed it."", ""Super trendy and fun coat! Keeps you nice and warm and perfect for the cold winters we have here in Buffalo, NY. this one is more versatile and less bulky. Still gives that perfect puffer look, but isn't too overwhelming to carry on your body. I got great compliments on it too! Perfect if you're looking for something to keep you warm and stylish."", 'My husband needed a warm coat in a freezing environment. He is very tall and difficult to buy for as not many coats fit his height. This coat is exactly what he needs. It fends off the chill and fits him perfectly!

I like well fitting coats and i am an athletic build and 185 lbs. The medium fit perfect. It is warm and not too heavy. Overall, this coat competes with others that are 3 times its price.', ""I got this for my bro cause he works outside everyday and he told me it gets really cold. So I got him this jacket and he really loves it. He said it is really comfortable and warm! We live in fl so we don't do too good in this cold weather lol! But I definitely recommend this jacket!"", ""Pay key attention to the heavy part of the this jacket. It's not necessarily that heavy in weight, but rather in insulation. This is a very warm coat, that is easily comfortable down to 0 degrees F. Unfortunately though, much above 30 degrees F the jacket is far too warm."", 'It seems very well made and has deep pockets. The hood fits easy over a winter hat or ball cap. It is very wind resistant as well as water resistant in light snow or rain.', ""The only thing that seems missing is a zipper garage. It doesn't really chafe my chin though with the way it snaps up tight, but something to keep in mind if you have sensitive skin.""]","['Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 66 ratings , based on 66 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 66 ratings , based on 66 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 66 ratings , based on 66 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 66 ratings , based on 66 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 66 ratings , based on 66 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 66 ratings , based on 66 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 66 ratings , based on 66 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 4.0 ) out of 5 stars 66 ratings , based on 66 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 4.0 ) out of 5 stars 66 ratings , based on 66 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 3.0 ) out of 5 stars 66 ratings , based on 66 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 66 ratings , based on 66 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 66 ratings , based on 66 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 66 ratings , based on 66 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 66 ratings , based on 66 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 66 ratings , based on 66 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 66 ratings , based on 66 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 66 ratings , based on 66 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 66 ratings , based on 66 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 66 ratings , based on 66 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 4.0 ) out of 5 stars 66 ratings , based on 66 reviews']",men's clothing

I would recommend this coat to anyone looking for a great cold weather garment."", 'Excellent well made coat for New York City winters. I am 5\'5"" 140 lbs, and the Small size fit me properly with enough space for a sweater underneath. (I debated getting a size larger so I could wear a suit jacket beneath the coat but decided that I would give more avenues for cold air to blow in from below if the coat is too loose.) The coat is thigh length so the choice of using the zipper or the buttons depends on whether you will be walking or sitting. The zipper isn\'t bi-directional, so if you will be seated for part of the trip (while driving, on the bus/train), then you must use the buttons. The one-way zipper only works if you are walking outside. Even with just the buttons, I found it comfortably warm (although would need the zipper closed if windy). The pockets are not padded but if it\'s that cold, you\'ll be wearing gloves anyway so not a problem. This works very well with temperature in the teens, don\'t feel any cold seeping through. It is water resistant but I wouldn\'t wear this is a pouring rain (if I\'m wearing this, it\'s too cold for rain!). The fur hood is nice, but I generally pair this with a Vbiger knit scull cap anyway. The fur is removable but I left it on so I don\'t lose it. After purchasing I started seeing many people wearing Rokka & Rolla coats, so this is a popular choice in cold climates.', 'Like that the fur collar can be detached. The coat is a ski coat/parka and keeps you very warm. My teenage fashionista son loves it and Lord knows he is picky. Designer this designer that, he likes the black (size large because even though he is tall & slim, medium was snug on him, so his dad ended up with the first coat purchased). Another point, the sleeve length was great for him my son. His dad loves the light colored one. He is slim and of average height. Fits him good (size medium). The coats made it through a winter season without any problems.', ""Super warm coat! It started wet snowing when I got out of work today (first day I tried it out) and this coat kept me warm and dry. The water doesn't stick to it either cause it's water resistant. I highly recommend this coat. I live in Buffalo, NY and this is by far the warmest coat I own! Better than ones I spent hundreds of dollars on. This coat is reasonable priced and super warm! Perfect for anyone looking for a solid deal on a great winter coat."", 'This coat is amazing!! The medium Fit my 6ft 157lb son great!! There was plenty of room! But if your going for a more fitted look I suggest sizing one down, its super quality and looks expensive! Extremely happy with this purchase it was super warm!!', ""I bought this jacket after reading some comments about how good it is. I figured I should give it a try. I can highly recommend this jacket! It's very warm and durable. I sometimes wear a t- shirt underneath it in Utah winter weather. I've been snowboarding with it and never felt cold even with just buttoning it up.

The image was what I was worried about when I was thinking about getting the shirt itself. Sometimes on cheaper shirts have images that are super heavy and when you wear the shirt itself, you'll find yourself totally sweating wherever the image is located, usually its because the image is caked on and thicker than any other part of the shirt. This shirt's image is perfect, its not heavy at all and you don't sweat where the image is."", ""The quality of the shirt itself is awesome in my opinion and its just right as far as being the perfect blend of cloth, its not heavy and its not to light, it's just right and perfect for a summer shirt, or under shirt in the winter if you're layering up. The image itself stands for Dragon Ball Z which is a sort of anime cartoon and seems to be really popular with the kids these days."", 'Overall:', ""I love the shirt, its perfect in the cloth's weight. The shirt itself to me is a above average shirt in quality and the image is perfectly balanced, not causing sweat or any discomfort when wearing it in the hot house or on a hot summer day. I would recommend this shirt to anyone at all! Highly Recommended!"", ""This is a very comfortable cotton shirt for every day wear. The shirt is made in Honduras and it is 100% cotton. The fit is relaxed. Size M is marked to fit sizes 38-40. I'm 5'6” and about 170 lbs right now. I had a baby last month and I am all about comfort and loose fit and this shirt is great for both. It is soft and machine washable. I love the fact that there are no tags. My husband likes Dragon Ball Z but he is not familiar with the print on this particular shirt. I like the contrast of white and red on black background. The emblem is designed to look slightly distressed and it looks like it will wear down nicely as the time goes on. Emblem is made of the rubbery type of material that reminds me of the type that you iron onto the fabric. I like the vintage look of it and how comfortable it is. It is a good shirt for chilling around the house, working out or even running errands. The fit is definitely unisex but on a looser side so if you like your t-shirts to be more fitted buy a size lower than your actual size."", ""This men's t-shirt is, I think, really well made. It is very soft and has a crew neck which I much rather prefer to the v-neck style t-shirts. It is made of a cotton and polyester blend. This keeps it from shrinking the way 100% cotton would do if dried in a dryer. I like the bright coloring and I think that the screen printing should last through many washings. The big test usually for most shirts is how the graphic holds up under drying. A lot of times the graphic will start to peel or bubble. So far this has not happened with this shirt. I am not a huge fan of anime but I have heard of Dragon Ball Z and my grandson was impressed when I showed him that I got this t-shirt."", ""I like the symbol on the front of the shirt it reminds me of loved ones I have from Japan even though I don't know much about the Dragon Ball Z Franchise I do know this is the ancient scripture for Japanese writing and that I like. The shirt is made of a nice soft 100% cotton material and will go nicely with my orange sweatshirt I just bought."", 'The feel of the fabric is nice and soft. The color of the graphic was good and a fun design. My husband liked the fit. It washed and dried without shrinking. I would definitely recommend checking out this T shirt line if you are in the market for one.', 'I received the Dragon Bail Kanji House symbol shirt a couple of days ago. I ordered it for my son from the Walmart Spark Reviewer program.', ""The fabric of the t-shirt is a good quality shirt. Not too heavy but not too thin either. The screen print design is rather large covering almost the whole width of the t-shirt. The design is only a white background with a red symbol. I'm not sure if the manufacturer meant to have the ink of the printed design to not be totally solid or not. It is not, if the shirt was printed this way on purpose for me it looks more like a defect in the screen printing process. Aside from this issue for me I think the design is very nice and so does my son."", ""The only size available was a medium. My son is a smaller statured size so the medium is a little large. Still looks fine on and him he likes the shirt. Seems like most people like to wear oversized t-shirts nowadays anyway. The t-shirt is made of 100% cotton. It's hard to tell how much a garment will shrink when it's 100% cotton. I found that when you want them to shrink they don't and vice versa. The t-shirt washed well and did not shrink much. I forgot to measure it before washing as I've done with other clothing in the past. However the shirt is still a little big which is why I say it didn't shrink much."", ""This Men's Dragon Ball Z Kame Kanji House Symbol Graphic T-shirt picked or my son which is right up his personal taste since he likes gaming and Dragon Ball Z. The fit, size, color, construction and printed design is fine. The fabric held up well during wash and drying with really not much shrinkage at all so fit stayed the same also fabric remained soft. The seams and how it was made is good. Son really like logo since seems old world and likes the game. The length was particularly great on Men's Dragon Ball Z Kame Kanji House Symbol Graphic T-shirt as my son is long on the torso so length was perfect for him.

It is light and fresh. Size M is somewhat wide but shrinks a little after washing.', 'It is a mixture of cotton and polyester, the neck is round.', 'My son has watched all the Dragon Ball series since he was a child, so he was excited.', 'It can be a detail for a person who likes Dragon Ball Z', ""The Dragon ball Z Men's t-shirt is 100% cotton. The size medium 38/40 is a good true medium and is a crew neck. It is a nice thickness, and not too thin, so I think it will last a long time. It is machine in cold water and tumble dry low. Do not iron or dry clean because of the silkscreen printed house logo. I love the logo, but I think the print was not done properly because there are a lot of black speckles on the white background and it is very noticeable. It gives the logo an old worn look, which is fine, but I do not think it is supposed to be that way. I tried washing it to see if the speckles come off, thinking it is lint from the black shirt, but to no avail. The speckles are still there. I must point out that this black stuff is not because the white print has rubbed off or cracked in any way. I still like this shirt, but I would hesitate to gift it because of the flaws. I always turn t-shirts inside out to wash so the logo prints will last longer as well. A good feature is that this t-shirt is tagless, as well."", ""Well son liked shirt, it's black and he's a gamer so what can I say! The Men's Dragon Ball Z Kame Kanji House Symbol Graphic T-Shirt wore well as expected and no stretching on neckline some others do. The shirt fabric is a bit light so good for warmer weather like here in Florida. It washed well, didn't notice lot of shrinkage and so far no color fading. It had the normal wrinkles you expect of a t-shirt coming out of the dryer so nothing unusual about that. The construction and sewing on it is good. Son like the worn out logo look like it's design. The shirt fit was spot on like my son like wearing his shirts and specially on the lengthwise since his torso is long. Well son is ok with the shirt and is fine wearing and looks good so thumbs up on this t-shirt.""]","['Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 15 ratings , based on 15 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 15 ratings , based on 15 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 15 ratings , based on 15 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 15 ratings , based on 15 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 15 ratings , based on 15 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 4.0 ) out of 5 stars 15 ratings , based on 15 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 4.0 ) out of 5 stars 15 ratings , based on 15 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 4.0 ) out of 5 stars 15 ratings , based on 15 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 3.0 ) out of 5 stars 15 ratings , based on 15 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 3.0 ) out of 5 stars 15 ratings , based on 15 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 4.0 ) out of 5 stars 15 ratings , based on 15 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 15 ratings , based on 15 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 15 ratings , based on 15 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 15 ratings , based on 15 reviews', 'Average Rating: ( 5.0 ) out of 5 stars 15 ratings , based on 15 reviews']",men's clothing

He couldn’t believe it and after kissing me all over my face...lol...he immediately went and charged it and hasn’t taken it off! He retired all of his other outerwear because he has an Ororo and that’s all he needs! It was by far one of the best, if not the best gift I’ve ever given him!

It's a comfortable jacket. It fits well and it's cozy.  My 1st impression was that it looked light. My concern was that it wouldn't shield me from the cold. I live in Canada and most of the time,  I go outside, I have no need to turn the heat on as long as the weather doesn't dip below zero. When it does, I typically use the hottest setting. I often don't wear anything bulky under my coat and the jacket keeps me toasty even when I wear a light sweater. I wish the jacket had a warmer setting because the maximum setting is not as warm as I prefer.  I work outside some days and the jacket keeps me warm. I have no need to stuff my coat pockets with heat packs like some of my coworkers. I do not feel hot when the jacket is set at at its highest heat setting - I am comfortable.  I tend to use a lower heat setting when I step on transit or step inside. The jackets price is good value. I would rather buy another Ororo jacket over a ridiculously expensive unethical Canada Goose jacket.  Plus, you don't need to over extend yourself financially to make a fashion statement because my coworkers noticed my heated jacket immediately when they noticed the button light when I powered it on. I prefer if the power button did not light up because I don't like drawing attention to my heated jacket.  Anyway,  it's a great investment.  I hope the company includes 2 batteries with future purchases because the cost of batteries are expensive. I recommend the jacket."", 'Lightweight comfortable good value battery lasts, just wish I found it years ago', 'Great jacket, even when not using the heating elements!

Walking my dogs means my gloves are constantly coming on and off so the heated pockets  is so handy I can pretty much leave one glove at home.  Anyone who does walk a dog will appreciate that when they are handing out treats or picking up waste.  The jacket for me was a mens small which fits true to size and it is so light.  The battery fits nicely into the left zippered pocket and is hardly noticeable.  Took it out yesterday for the first test and it was minus 12 C.  I had the jacket on low and it worked great.The wind was blowing but the jacket did a great job keeping it out.    It also has a water resistant full length zipper and storm cuffs.  Maybe there next generation model could have zippered pockets to keep things like mitts or treats from falling out, otherwise I think I made a wise purchase.  The fabric on this appears easy to clean as I found out yesterday when a dog with muddy paws jumped up to say hello.

If it were stolen tomorrow, I would replace it with another. \n\nWishes: \nVest with hidden on/off button. \nHeated gloves / hood accessories \nShoulder heating \n\nAll in all, nicely done.

However, as soon as I put this shirt on, I realized it fit differently than the others I’ve tried. It fits snug around the arms and shoulders, but is just loose enough at the waist that it doesn’t feel like I’m being suffocated! I received the LARGE which states that it should be a good fit for someone with a 40 chest. I would normally wear a 42, so that’s where I can see the “snugness” coming in. For reference, I am 5’10”, 190, and work out roughly four times per week. I like that I can wash this with colors or whites, and then toss it into the dryer on low. Easy peasy! This is going to come in nicely for that one extra layer on days I need to warm up just a little more at the gym or on a walk/jog.', ""When I opened the package, I could see that this was a high quality, well-made product. The stitching of the seams is very well done, and it's evident that this shirt will last a long time. It's cool and comfortable when wearing during my workout, and it looks so good!

Well worth the price!"", ""Tried it on as soon as it was delivered. I'm 6', 190 lbs and the large that was sent fits like a glove.

Seems to be very good quality.', ""I've wore compression shorts and even socks before so I was anxious to try this shirt out. The sizing was appropriate to other t-shirts I wear so stick with that. Due the stay-at-home guidance I worked it in my basement and the shirt was very comfortable and actually kept me cooler than normal during my workout. I am looking forward to wearing it on runs because of this quality. I enjoyed the stretchability of the fabric and this will become a stable in my workout clothing apparel.

IDK, I guess I need to sweat for it to cool me down?"", ""I assumed compression meant it would be tight, which it was a little uncomfortably tight around my arms and neck.

It is a nice material and looks very nice when worn, it just doesn't fit ME the way I felt like a compression shirt should."", 'This Thermajohn Compression T-Shirt is exactly what is advertised and seems to be high quality so far. I ordered X-Large because that is the regular size of shirt that I wear. At first, it seemed like it was going to be too tight of a fit, but the more I wore it the more comfortable I realized that it was and that the size was just right for me. Of course, I also knew that a compression shirt is designed to be a somewhat snug fit. I am not really into “working out” (I stay more in shape by working outside on our property cutting wood, working in my shop, etc), but I really like the feel and look of this shirt for just going out on the town for dinner, etc. I have also found myself lounging around the house in it because it is so lightweight and comfortable. The look and feel of the shirt really remind me a lot of the Under Armor brand of clothing and this line of clothing is a great value for the quality. I would make sure to follow the cleaning instructions carefully – drying this type of clothing with medium or high heat can shrink and weaken the mostly polyester material. I usually prefer to just air -dry clothing like this. These shirts are a good quality for the price.', 'I started working out. Getting old. Just so sore afterward. Decided to give this a try. I’m a little impressed. I was less sore and more dry. Well I don’t feel wet like I did with a plain t-shirt.

So far I like it.', ""This Thermajohn Men Compression T-Shirt feels very comfortable to wear and it's breathable so it helps to reduce odor and sweating while exercising.

I do recommend the Thermajohn Men Short Sleeve Baselayer Cool Dry Compression T-Shirt for Athletic Workout and Running.', 'The Thermajohn Men Short Sleeve Baselayer Cool Dry Compression T-Shirt, for Athletic Workout and Running, is a great compression t-shirt. I am an older guy, who works out at the gym some, and does things like golf, kayaking, and hiking, but nothing too strenuous. So I am probably not the best guy to review a compression shirt, but I have to say that wearing it, while doing my activities, seemed to give me more endurance, and I definitely did not get tired as quickly as usual. I fits great, and even helps hold in my belly. I like how it makes my biceps look better, and it definitely kept me feeling dryer, when I was sweating. As for helping me after a workout, I probably do not work out hard enough to see, feel, or notice those benefits, but if it might be helping, then I will keep wearing it. So if you are looking for a compression t-shirt, I recommend giving the Thermajohn Men Short Sleeve Baselayer Cool Dry Compression T-Shirt a try.', ""The Thermajohn Men Short Sleeve Baselayer Cool Dry Compression T-Shirt for Athletic Workout and Running fits true to size, is fairly long in the torso making it easy to tuck in, and has good sleeve lengths and a comfortable collar.

Recommended!"", ""I found this shirt to be a nice lightweight shirt. The shirt is form fitting, I got mine oversized but almost wish I hadn't. the material is very breathable and makes for a great shirt to wear when involved in physical activity or in very warm weather. It can be used as a baselayer or it is fashionable enough to wear by itself as an outer layer. I found it to keep me cooler and dryer then most of my other apparel. The light gray color is nice if out in the sun it is not absorbing the heat from the sun as do many darker colors. Almost immediately the letter from the logo started pealing but this has no effect on the quality of the shirt."", ""I needed a new exercise/workout shirt so I tried the Thermajohn Men Short Sleeve Baselayer Cool Dry Compression T-Shirt for Athletic Workout and Running. It is a nice looking shirt and the material is soft and flexible. It doesn't stretch at all. I guess if your really thin and in shape this would be a good choice. However, I am 5'9 and 225 pounds. I wear 2X shirts. It came in 2X so I got it. When I put the shirt on it was really tight like a medium and it was not comfortable. I want to be able to breathe while I am exercising! I would have to be 50lbs lighter to fit comfortably in the shirt. I received the product from the Spark Reviewer program."", 'This shirt is made with high quality and looks and feels good. Wicks the sweat away so your not staying wet from all that sweat all the time. Feels very comfortable and made with quality materials.
