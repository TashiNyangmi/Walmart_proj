The recommended care of this pant is machine wash cold and tumble dry low. Although this pant is loose on her, she can always grow into it. I really like the adjustable waist band that this pant has to offer. I've also noticed that with other adjustable waist band pants, the elastic band can get lost in the slits located on the inside of the pants. But with these pants, the adjustable elastic band is actually sewn onto the inside of the pants so you will never lose the elastic band inside the “abyss” of the adjustable slits. The stitching is done with quality and I appreciate that they used a faux button on the front. A metal hook and bar clasp are used for the front button and my daughter will not have to struggle with a button during bathroom breaks.

They got holes in the knees with ease.', 'I then decided to go on a search for some new pants. I found these and live them and wanted to leave a great review and love that these meet the needs of my active Child. Because of what I read about these pants online, I was very eager to give them a try. I love them. They fit perfect and had lots of room to grow. It just let me know that the other brand pants clearly were not made with good fabric or to last. These were a tad long, but my daughter is tall and growing taller by the minute :) and so I just had to fold the legs up a bit and it worked perfectly for her. 1. They do not fit snug in the butt area from the start, they are roomy. 2. They are not skinny but instead boot cut pants. 3. Once washed they kept their true size over and over and over... no shrinking occurred. 4. They never got holes in the knees even though my daughter played just as hard in this brand and pair of pants as she did in the earlier pants purchased. I am very pleased with this product.', ""My daughter loves these Wonder Nation Girls Uniform pants. They look and fit great. They are made from stretchy material so they fit better than other twill pants. Also they are machine washable and didn't shrink. My daughter is on the thin side so the skinny pants weren't too big.

The length is totally appropiate.', 'Elementary school student', 'Girls School Uniform Pleated Belted Scooter was selected through the Wal Mart Spark Program in exchange for my honest opinion. This is one cute little scooter for a little girl. If your child has to wear uniforms, this is the perfect uniform bottom. It can either be worn for uniform purpose or it can be worn as a skirt for church or you can dress it up or down. This scooter can also be used as an everyday bottom. Very cute with a button down or a polo shirt. My daughter put this scooter on with easy and she said it was very comfortable. She loves wearing it to school. This is her go to the scooter. She loves the girly girl look and skirts are her thing but she needs shorts so this works perfectly for her school uniform. She either wears flats or tennis shoes with her uniform top. Depends on if she is going to the gym that day or not but she rather wear the flats. Yes, I highly recommend this scooter for all little girls that still want the girlie girl look while attending school and having to wear uniforms.

I have never heard of that before so I had to look it up to understand what kind of fabric we are talking about. The twill fabric has a diagonal weave which makes it stretchy and comfortable. I looked at the tag and it says it is made of 97% Cotton and 3% Spandex. That is the reason these pants are so comfortable. You have the comforts from the twill fabric and the cotton fabric. They are also very stretchy. You get that from the twill fabric and the spandex fabric. They used the right fabric in order to make these Pull-On Pants. The Twill and Spandex work great for pulling these pants up and down to get them on and off with ease. In front of the pants, it looks like it has a zipper but it doesn't. It has a wide waistband with elastic in it for pulling them up and down with ease also. The waistband is made very thick. I think it will last a long time. These pants seem to be made very well. The pants have two side pockets that have ample room inside. There are also two pockets in the back. The pants that I received are black and very pretty and stylish. They can be worn at school or any social gathering. My granddaughter has a party coming up and she will be wearing these pants to it. They look very nice. They do not look cheap or cheaply made. They look very fashionable. She was very pleased with them. The size that I have is an 8 and they seem to be true to size. This is the same size that she wears in other clothes. I have not washed them yet so I do not know if they will shrink or not. They also come in Khaki and Navy. I highly recommend these pants."", 'These are great uniform pants. The only thing I wish, regarding the style, is that the ankle was more skinny fit, so the leg is not so wide at the ankle. My daughter said the elastic waistband is comfortable and she really likes the pants. They fit true to size, just wide through the legs. They are thicker material, so they will hold up really well, and stay warm in the Winter. I received sizes for each of my daughters and both had the issue, with the ankle being too wide. So, it would be nice if they were more skinny fit, to look more stylish. Other than that, they are great pants.', 'I have bought a pair of pants for my oldest daughter in this brand before in a similar style. These pants have the stretchy waistline instead of the button and adjustable hidden buttons. I like both kinds that they put out now. I did not see that these adjust any in the waist other than just simply stretching. My oldest daughter is eight and a half and she has always been a little bit more of on the small side. So we got her the size seven which is what she wears right now and last year too the pants were a great fit and just long enough. There was room to grow tall and a little wider too. They stayed up on her hips even though there was room in the back still for the butt to grow a little more. It did not feel too long or too wide. Perfect fit for her and she likes them. They are comfortable and move better than her other pair of pants that are from the same brand. They washed well and I did not see any fade or tearing or any wear. I am thinking they will hold up very nice for the school year and even though our school does not do uniforms I plan to buy some of these pants for both of my kids because they are so nice of pants and they feel soft and comfortable yet durable looking khakis. I think they can flip hop, run and jump in these just fine. My kids have special needs and I got the thumbs up from my oldest daughter. I hope my young one will love it to since she has so much sensory issues but I am guessing she will. The color looks like a normal navy and I hope to find they offer these in all the normal colors you would typically find pants in like white, khaki, black etc.', ""School uniforms are life saving and at the same time a pain. The good thing is that your kids don't have to stand in front of the closet every morning to choose what to wear to school. The bad thing is that they constantly grow out of the uniforms and sometimes you have to buy new set during school year. I like these Wonder Nation Girls School Uniform Stretch Twill Pull-On Pants because they are super stretchy and easy to put on or take off. The prints have four functional pockets and a reinforced knee for added durability. These pants are equipped with a special stain release treatment, so they will stay looking new even longer.

I like these pants and recommend them for children.', ""My daughter is going into the 7th grade and wears uniforms to her school. Compared to other brands, these have so many great qualities. The fabric is soft and breathable, not thick and stiff like other uniform brands. The soft fabric also makes it easier to roll a cuff at the bottom if they're too long. My daughter loved that the waist was stretchy instead of having a button and zipper. She's tall for her age and these were a good length, giving her some room to grow. She typically wears a 14/16 or XL in girls clothes. So, they're a little baggy on her. But, overall, we like them and they're good quality."", ""These pants are adorable. They are softer than I expected, which is a good thing. They have a stretchy waistband, which my daughter loves! The color is great and even after a few washes, they still look new. The only drawback for me is the length. My daughter is on the short side, and these are too long for her, so they'll have to be hemmed."", 'These are great uniform pants. The only thing I wish, regarding the style, is that the ankle was more skinny fit, so the leg is not so wide at the ankle. My daughter said the elastic waistband is comfortable and she really likes the pants. They fit true to size, just wide through the legs. They are thicker material, so they will hold up really well, and stay warm in the Winter.', ""I have a little girl stating kinder this fall, this is her first uniform pants she gets to wear, I like the material and the fact that the knees are reinforced. However, my daughter is on the slim side, if your kids are slim these pants will not fit perfectly, the stretchy waist is a little too big for my daughter, I will fix it myself so that it fits proper. Other than that the length of the pants legs is perfect, true to size definitely. The blue is very dark and I'm really hoping it doesn't fade right away."", ""My daughter's love these pants. When I asked them about the pants and how they fit and how they liked them. They said that they love the pants and that they are very comfy.

Easy to bend and play with this type of material yet also heavy duty to tolerate wear and tear of a young girl. Wish this was the material and style for boys.

When my daughter put it on I wanted to squeeze her so hard. It is super high quality and it is very functional. My daughter has already abused this skirt and it still looks amazing after several washes. It is a navy blue and looks great with a variety of tops. It has a short underlay (its a scourt) so she can play to her little hearts desire without showing too much. It fits great and has an adjustable waistband. She does attend a uniform school but it is so cute it could be worn anywhere. My daughter loves it to because she knows how adorable she looks in it and it is comfortable for her to look pretty and play in. I definitely recommend.', 'I love the detail on this skirt. The bow on the front of the waist is nice and beautiful. I love that it does not get undone because it is stitched to stay in place. The silver circle accents give it a nice touch also. I like that the material feels like silk a little. The material is durable and will withstand many washes without fading or shrinking. It is made of 100 percent polyester. The best part is that it has shorts underneath. It is the perfect skirt to wear to school any day of the week. It gives school uniforms a whole new look that I love. With that said, I highly recommend this skirt, and brand.', ""It's a great skirt. Fit my baby girl really well. She doesn't go to a uniform school but it is super cute and it's soft. Minute we got it my girl wanted to wear it. Too bad she didn't want to sit still for the Pic."", ""I would recommend this for any kid that like skirts. It's good for church and school and straight play. Thinking about buying another one."", 'What can I say with this school uniform skirt made by Wonder Nation, it is so adorable and fits well to my daughter.\xa0The school changed their uniform this year, and this is a perfect skirt for her.\xa0So definitely I will be buying more school uniform this year in Wonder Nation brand. The accent bow in front is nice touched, and the pleated skirt has a back elastic waistband for natural pull-on comfort. My daughter will never have to worry about the zipper and button.\xa0The dress has sewn in short inside, so the outfit from school learning time to playtime after school is no problem at all.\xa0I washed it with cold water and low heat dryer, the fabric did not shrink, did not fade the gray color, and less wrinkled than I expected. The durable polyester twill fabric made this skirt.\xa0Now my daughter wants to use the same gray skirt or skort for anime costume birthday party. As spark reviewer, I suggest this Skirt by Wonder Nation. The school year will start in a month, so start shopping your kid(s) uniform at Walmart and look for Wonder Nation brand ^_^.', ""Okay, so I have a leggy six year old girl. It just so happens that this year they do not have a set uniform to wear. But, for me, it is so much easier to have a few basic mix and match bottoms and several more basic mix and match tops. So this size 6 navy blue bow skirt with shorts underneath fits really well into her school wardrobe. The length works, so it is not too short to wear to school, while still being a cute length for a child. The shorts underneath are an absolute must for an active six year old. I don't even buy skirts without shorts underneath unless she's going to wear tights with them. And actually, she can wear tights with this skirt in the winter time. The skirt and shorts are 100% polyester. So it's not breathable, but keeps wrinkles away really well. The waistband is about an inch and the front is very sturdy and flat, with a center bow. The back of the waistband is gathered and stretchy. The three pleats in the front are really schoolgirl cute and allows for more movement during exercise time and outside play. There are no pleats or pockets in the back, which is fine. My little one is tall and skinny (48lbs, about 4'2”) and the waist is a tiny bit big on her, but I give it a few more months and it will be fitting fine. The one thing that would put this skirt over the top is if it had front pockets."", ""This is a good quality skirt for school. Cute little belt design on the front with pleats. I bought this fir my 9nyr old who's on the smaller size (4 ft 4, 56lbs, size 10/12) and it was too big for her as there isn't any way to tighten the skirt. This did fit my 12 (4 ft 11.5, 62lbs) year old who usually wears 14/16 as she's long legged. He came down to her knees and didn't need to be tightened"", 'I have a 6.5 year old daughter that would wear skirts and dresses everyday if I let her. Unfortunately, with her growing up with brothers, she doesn\'t usually sit ""properly"" which is a concern of mine once she started school. I generally would make her wear pants/shorts to school, despite her begging to wear skirts/dresses. One the days I do give in to let her wear a dress/skirt, I would always make her wear a pair of cotton shorts underneath. I could not wait for her to give these a try because they have the shorts already built into the skirt. I chose to get the skirt in a size 7 because she generally wears clothing between a size 6 to a size 8 (depending on the brand, etc.). This particular brand seems to run a little on the bigger side, but I\'m sure within in the next month she will fit it perfectly, just in time for school to start. It is mostly only big in the waist portion, but I feel like once it gets washed a time or two, it will provide a better fit for her. I love the dark, black color this skirt has and the bow is a huge winning point for my daughter. Another thing to take note of is the length of this skirt. I was expecting a skirt that would be about mid-thigh area whereas this one comes completely down to her knees. The material this skirt is made out of seems like it is not only comfortable for her to wear, but that it is also durable enough to last for many years to come. Overall, I am completely satisfied with this skirt. The color looks amazing, the bow makes it unique and I feel like it will last her for a few years until she outgrows it. I would recommend this skirt to anyone with a child headed back to school. I feel like it can be worn for any school setting and would go perfectly with any shirt.', 'This skirt is made in Vietnam. The skirt and shorts are made from 100% polyester. The skirt is fairy thick and not see thru at all. The front has pleats and the back is smooth. The waist is very stretchy elastic. The front design is so adorable with the metal rings and a ribbon bow. The bow is sewn on and cannot be adjusted.', ""The skirt underneath is thin. I would suggest having the child wear neutral under garments so that you cannot see a print, but otherwise is great. Your child can do cartwheels and all the running they want without showing anything they shouldn't."", 'The skirt seems pretty true to size. My child just had a growth spurt and her waist is a tad thinner right now. So the skirt fits, but is a little big in the waist. This will probably fit her perfect in the fall.', 'This skirt has the approval from my child. I would love if it were in cotton rather than polyester, but beautiful skirt.', ""This is a cute scooter. It's durable, easy care, comfortable. The material has a nice soft feel to it. The elastic waistband is great for my granddaughter. I also love the built-in shorts since my granddaughter is very active at school. The size was a true fit, even after washing and drying it fit great and comfy. The scooter can also be worn outside of school with a cute shirt. The only complaint I have, is I wish it was about an inch longer but other than that this is an awesome scooter that's prices right."", 'My 6.5 year old daughter absolutely LOVES wearing skirts/dresses to school. Unfortunately, she doesn\'t sit ""properly"" while wearing them unless I\'m there to constantly remind her. For this reason, I generally make her wear a pair of shorts under her skirts and dresses. With school starting back in about a month, I know she is going to want to wear skirts to school. This cute skirt comes with the shorts already built in, so therefore I feel more inclined to let her wear these to school. I think this skirt would be perfect for any school-type setting. I chose to get the skirt in a size 7 since my daughter wears clothes in a size 6 up to a size 8 (depending on the brand). I will say, this skirt runs a bit on the larger side. The waist is currently a bit lose on her, but I\'m sure she will quickly grow into it, possibly before school even starts. The cute bow really brings this skirt together and I feel like it will last her through the school year with no issues. I also like how well this color can be matched with about any shirt. Overall, I am satisfied with this skirt and I feel like it would be a great addition to any wardrobe for school age children.', ""This skirt was a long awaited surprise for my daughter! She loves skirts, but I have been hesitant to let her wear one to school, as she isn't good with sitting properly. But this skirt, unlike many others I have bought, has sewn in biking shorts!! It also has a really cute bow on the top, which was absolutely adorable and I knew my daughter would love it. However, when she tried this skirt on, it was WAY too big! She is a size 5 in other children's clothes, but this size 5 was a lot larger than normal. She was very disappointed, but I promised to hold on to them so she can wear it when she gets bigger. The beige color would into what is acceptable for most school uniforms and the length is appropriate.

It fit a little big but it gives her room to grow for the school year. So as long as the skort can make it through the wash she should be able to wear it all school year. I do reccomend taking it out of the dryer immediately so you will not have to iron it. It dries quite nicely but if left in the pile of clothes too long it will need to be ironed as it will be full of wrinkles.', 'this is a great scooter skirt, very stylish and my child really enjoyed it. we do not have to use uniforms but she already has planned a outfit for back to school with this skirt. i like the built in shorts to keep my childs modesty while still being able to be a kid. overall great qualit great skirt. my daughter wears a size 12 and this skirt is a size 12 and it was slighly big.', ""This skirt was a long awaited surprise for my daughter!

I would definitely recommend this product to my friends and family.', ""I received this cute Girls Plus School Uniform Button Side Tab Scooter in exchange of an honest review. I order this skirt for my baby girl who is 10 years old. My daughter is taller then she should be for her age. I was a bit concern if it would fit my daughter. She is different size due to her being skinny and tall. When I received the Girls Plus School Uniform Button Side Tab Scooter I was happy about the color. It's a nice blue nave color. Which is uniform approved. The color was good the length had me a bit worried. It looked a bit too short for her long legs. I'm the kind of mom I won't let my daughter wear anything too short . Especially if she going to school or anywhere outside the house. When she tried it, it was just perfect not to short or too long. Even though it was just the right size I always want my daughters to make sure they wear a shorts under their skirts. That's another thing I like about this skirt , it comes with small shorts under the skirt Stitch to it. She needs no shorts under , all she does it put on the Girls Plus School Uniform Button Side Tab Scooter and she's ready to go. The waist is adjustable , makes it fit just right. The material is made of is very thick and strong material. The stitches are very good and tight. This Girls Plus School Uniform Button Side Tab Scooter won't be ripping easily. When I wash the Girls Plus School Uniform Button Side Tab Scooter I try not to wash it in hot water I feel like it will fade after so many times. I rather wash it cold or warm water. I dont know if it shrinks or not so I just hang it up to dry on its own. The best thing about this is a price , I've looked everywhere for good prices and for uniform this is the best quality of clothes and price. I recomend this Girls Plus School Uniform Button Side Tab Scooter to everyone. Your girl will love it."", 'This skirt is a nice wrinkle resistant uniform skirt.
