I recently purchased a pair of these for myself and have been very happy with them. Quality is excellent, fit and finish great. I hadn\'t had a pair of Wranglers since my youth many years ago - and up to recently did not even consider them. I refuse to pay 50 to 100 dollars just for a pair of jeans.  And I don\'t like any stretch fabric - I want 100% cotton.  And I don\'t want them ""pre-distressed"". I will distress them myself through wear and work.

But don\'t tell him.\nOn top of that, the delivery time from Walmart was excellent and beat all expectations.', ""The Wrangler jeans were exactly the color and quality I've come to expect from Wrangler.  However, they were mismarked.  I ordered size 34 x 30 relaxed fit, but when they arrived they had the 34 x 30 relaxed fit sticky tag on the leg but the inside cloth tag was 34 x 30 regular fit.  I assume the mistake was made by the manufacturer and not made by the packaging/handling person.

I was quite surprised by the fit of this thermal shirt. I\'m 6\'3"" tall, 200 pounds and this shirt is a large but it fits very well. Sure I don\'t have the body to model this shirt so you\'ll have to forgive me for the photos. I have long arms and these sleeves fit great and the tail is cut square and is long enough to wear out or to tuck in and when you bend over it doesn\'t crawl up your back, it stays put and doesn\'t expose your backside. It has 3 buttons at the neck and looks good enough on its own if you want to wear it as a shirt. I would like to tell you that it will keep you nice and warm in cold weather but we\'re still over 100 degrees here in Arizona so it\'s tough to tell you just how well it will work when it\'s cold.', ""The selling point of this shirt is that it's a Henley. The three-button front makes it a presentable baselayer and not another ugly generic undershirt you want to keep hidden. The grey coloring is light and the not typical dark grey. The shirt is made up of 54% percent cotton and 46% percent that combines to make a soft and comfortable wear—see attached photo of label. Right now, here in Florida, it's the middle of summer, so it's impossible for me to accurately say if this'll keep you warm in the middle of an Arctic winter. Instead, I can say this shirt is comfortable, stylish, and cool enough to be worn indoors—Thank you air conditioning! —during the warm summer Florida months. My only complaint would be that it has a generous cut. I received a size Large, my normal size, yet it fits loosely. If used as a baselayer it should have a tighter fit, so perhaps consider this when ordering."", ""This is my review of the Fruit of the Loom Men's Classic Waffle Thermal Henley Shirt. I usually wear these shirts during the winter months, under another shirt. This time of year I will wear it as my only shirt, because they look very nice. They are completely warm to wear as a only shirt when the weather starts to get cool and can handle the very cold weather under another shirt and coat when real winter sets in. Fruit of the Loom Men's Classic are always a great quality material and fit nicely. One thing about Thermal clothing you want it to fit well. The quality of Fruit of the Loom has always been good and they continue to hold up while other makers of thermal clothing are starting to be less good in their final made quality. The sleeves fit nice and are the correct length and the buttons do not pop off after a couple of washes. I have the grey, but have purchased the black and dark blue previously. They all have maintained their quality and color appearance over the years. Just a nice addition to your causal wear and a get addition to your layer when the weather is freezing outside. Would recommend this shirt."", 'This is a very soft shirt warm but not hot it breathes very well for maximum comfort it is stylish as well as serving as a undergarment or could be used as a pajama top it is very well constructed color gives many options as to purpose would recommend too anyone I suppose a woman might wear if dressed in the right clothes.', 'August may be the wrong month for thermal underwear but you do have to plan for the cold days ahead. This top fits well and would stretch comfortably for a larger person. The sleeves are cuffed and the neck has three large buttons. It is lightweight and would allow for layering with a tee shirt. I anticipate wearing this top with a flannel shirt, left unbuttoned. In the cold it should provide the heat you need and once inside you could remove the flannel shirt and still loo presentable in a casual way. This top does not look like underwear.', ""Great thermal shirt by Fruit of the Loom. Not bulky and cumbersome as others have been. Lightweight and comfortable. Doesn't bind at the neckline. From shoulders to wrist bands perfect. Set around chest and midriff are great. Pleasantly surprised. Easy maintenance and upkeep. Weather warren plain or with a shirt over it provides a great look. Easy to tuck in and stay in place. Now that's a perk. You just couldn't ask for better. Made by a company who you can trust. Quality. Timeless piece of clothing material."", ""I received the Fruit of the Loom Men's Classic Waffle Thermal Henley Shirt to give my honest opinion. But I have had the same thermal shirt for a couple of years now, and unfortunately, it's all worn out. So, when I came across this offer, I knew I had to take advantage of it. I'm about 5'7-5'8 and about 125-135 pounds; I must admit size medium fits me precisely. Some of the things I like about the Fruit of the Loom Men's Classic Waffle Thermal Henley Shirt is that it is machine washable, retains heat, cotton-rich fabric and its stretchable. One of the unique qualities of this thermal Henley shirt is it is built for the winter. Even though, it is not an expensive puffer jacket; don't get carried away because the Fruit of the Loom Men's Classic Waffle Thermal Henley Shirt can retain heat. Because it can retain heat, I noticed whenever I wear a thermal under my thin sweater during winter, I am kept warm throughout the day. But to conclude, I am a fan of the Fruit of the Loom brand and would recommend the Fruit of the Loom Men's Classic Waffle Thermal Henley Shirt to anyone who wants to stay warm during the winter months at an affordable price."", ""This review is for a Fruit of the Loom Men's Classic Waffle Thermal Henley Shirt. This shirt is lightweight yet strong enough to stretch with you and the three button henley option keeps me from feeling choked. The shirts are more polyester than cotton but still shrink some after washing and drying so make your size choices accordingly. The waffling of the material is what keeps you warm all the while wicking moisture away from your skin which also aids in staying warm. I do like the elastic cuff on each arm that aids in keeping the sleeve from wadding up around your elbows. The only complaint that I have is the length. I'm 6' 3”, 200 lbs and they are a little short for my particular situation. There are ample color choices for me as these are normally worn under another shirt so huge color choices are not as important to me as is warmth and comfort. I think one of my favorite features is the tagless technology. No more scratching on the back of my neck. I can physically see the tag that appears to be printed on the inside but never bleeds through so it's not visible from the outside of the shirt. I recommend these shirts if you need to stay warm and dry."", 'Nice fall/early spring thermal layer. Not too thick, not too lightweight. Length on large seemed a little shorter than I would like, while the arms seemed baggy. Washing it in warm water seemed to shrink the arms more than the length so it ended up working out well. Ends did not fray after wash like some other thermals I have owned.', ""The shirt is decent quality, though personally I'd prefer something a bit softer with a better fit. Perhaps it's the freedom that I like from wearing short sleeved tees, but the thermal shirt does fit snugly and would definitely keep me warm during those cold evenings (though this being the summer months, it's still be pretty warm out). I like the waffle pattern and overall feel, but the fit for some reason feels just a tad unnatural (most likely my personal body build). All in all, the three buttons in front are nice and it's a good shirt."", ""This shirt looks great, but the size is a bit inaccurate compared to most of my clothes as it fits a big too snug. I normally wear large shirts whereas this shirt would probably fit better in extra large. The The fabric is also bit rough the to point that I might want to wear a softer t-shirt underneath this. I can't judge how much protection it gives against cold weather because it 100 degrees here."", ""Fruit of the Loom Men's Classic Waffle Thermal Henley Shirt fits well. Fits nice without any trouble to the skin, very soft and easy fit. Maintains temperature and would be a great addition to winter wear. This is a great combo to go along with any full or half shirts during winter. Men would love to wear this under their shirts or T'shirts."", 'Living in Minnesota the winters get quite cold. This Fruit of the Loom Henley Waffle Shirt will help keep the cold out and still have a nice warm comfortable feel. The look is good. The comfort is quite nice. The fit is perfect. I like the price also.', 'I normally use ordinary Fruit of the Loom T shirts and am quite happy with those. This T Shirt works as a shirt by itself( I think because of the style and color) or an undershirt for the cold winters.', 'Out of the package it has a strong smell so I have to wash before I can wear. I know its recommended to wash all clothing before using it. However, I like to wear new clothes before washing while they are in perfect condition.

I will be heading back to look for this Henley Shirt and see what color options are available for this upcoming winter...."", 'This being a Fruit of the Loom item, I knew this was going to be a quality product, but upon wearing it, it was so tight on me because this was a"" medium ""size shirt. I was suppose to have received a large, but I receive a medium and it\'s so tight on me, I gave it to my wife to wear and she like\'s it. The shirt material is thin, and can almost see through it, and I know the first time washing it, it will shrink, so those who are thinking about purchasing this item make sure it\'s a extra size up or more. I truly like this item but I deduct a star for the sizing of the shirt. (If I wear a large, I would go up to a ""extra large"").

I can tuck the bottom in because the top is long enough or leave it out and it looks great .I wear thermals every winter to keep my joints warm so no arthritis starts ever .Mine are medium with a good sizing that neither shrinks or fades .I will buy more of this brand .Great name brand Fruit of the Loom equals quality as they have many years .', ""I have used the Fruit of the Loom brand Henley's for about 15 years and they have always kept me warm and have been durable. This material is very soft and looks like the mesh design has been reduced or tighten to a smaller pattern. I have one that I bought two years ago and did a side by side comparison. The collar has been increased to one inch from the three-quarters that my two year old top has. The stitching seems more robust in the neck area and on the back side of the button area. The button area seems to have widen slightly also, the waist area has also had a increase in stitching. The cuff area has seen a big increase in the cuff from slightly over two inches to over three inches on the new top. That should decrease the amount of arm slide from the top. I did try the top on and it did fit like a glove, after washing in cold and drying on low, I did not notice any shrinkage in the fit or any odd bunching from the material. The material is very comfortable on the skin."", ""The Fruit of the Loon Men's Classic Waffle Thermal Henley Shirt is the most comfortable thermal shirt I have ever worn. The waffle design is fantastic and it looks good, even though no one will be able to see it during the cold days, for it will be under a shirt and jacket.

The Hanes shirt is more full cut and has a longer length while the Starter shirt has a slimmer cut. Workmanship seems comparable. I wear these shirts while playing table tennis and was able to saturate both shirts quite easily. The moisture wicking ability of the Hanes seems to be slightly better but neither shirt will keep you dry if you sweat a lot. However, both will dry faster than a 100% cotton t-shirt.

Swearpants']","['These are a beautiful pair of top quality pants to wear, that fit nicely and are not baggy, giving a dressier look with quality side vertical zippers for the cargo area. (I actually prefer a top entrance cargo pocket, but these are very nice.) Both cargo pockets are 9 wide, and 8 deep. The pants are cotton AND polyester, with the outside being very tight and smooth, and the inside being the softer fleece. The outside has remained tight and smooth, but the inside being softer do seem to have small pieces of the material that does come out when I remove them at night. (They\'re still new and haven\'t been washed yet.) The bottoms of the pant legs are fully adjustable with bungee cords, but do leave the cord showing; but not a problem. Some people have stated that the inner waist cord isn\'t long enough; but I find it fits correctly with a ½ inch solid flat drawstring, and NOT the cheap thin type of rope material. It leaves more than enough to tie a very solid bow tie that stays INSIDE the pants, making a smooth finished look. If you are a medium build or have regular or thinner legs they\'ll fit without looking like balloon legs; giving a slimmer normal look. No they aren\'t slim cut, just normal and comfortable. They do make another pair having a looser fit, with topside cargo pockets for the same price. I have another pair of another pair that are cargo pants like these in fit, and weighted both separately. The Vibes in medium weighed 12 ounces, and my other pair (new) was lighter at 8 ounces. The Vibes just seem so much nicer quality.  I would recommend these pants for everyday wear because they\'re so well fitting and finished, or for a gym workout. I\'ve also ordered a second pair for ""backup"".', 'These pants arrived by FedEx on time, and fit exactly according to size. (You CAN check their measurements for sizing..med is 34 yo 36 inches.) Soft tight weave cotton exterior, polyester fleece interior. I like the waist cord being INSIDE so it doesn\'t show. Cord allows for tying without excessive slack for a better tailored look. The zippers on the cargo area aren\'t on the top, strong and well made, but sideways for a classier more finished look.  These items must be washed with warm water, gentle cycle, and dried with a lower heat setting or air dried. The length is proper, and sits on the shoe properly, but can be adjusted with the bungee cords. The can stick out and become tangled, so I tied them in a loop. One side had a top slot to pass through, the other didn\'t. Also I hate a baggy look around the top section, and fit REALLY nice and comfortable. I like that I can wear them for everyday  without looking like ""work out pants"". If you have a larger ""lower section"" and wide legs, I suggest their other model with the relaxed fit, and Velcro closures.  I\'m going to buy another pair because I\'m crazy, and want to have a back up pair in my closet. They\'re 60% cotton/40% polyester. GREATEST VALUE/QUALITY for the money.

The snug fit might be a plus, since you will probably wear this under another shirt in the winter. I think this will be useful when the temperatures are in the single digits or teens, and I need to go outside to shovel snow. Unless you are a thin build, you will probably opt for the large size.

I use this for early morning running on the weekends to where it's cool so this shirt keeps me warm enough but not where it's uncomfortably hot. I have lost a lot of weight so all the loose skin stays in place when I'm running which makes it easier for me to run.

Thankfully that is not the case and the shirt I got as an XL is plenty long enough in tail and sleeves for me at 6' 2” and whether you take XL or XLT I think this size on this shirt is correct and works for by regular and tall size needs...I'm guessing other sizes are correct as well."", ""In the past I would have given the shirt 5-stars, but I think after what has happen in 2020, consumers are much more concerned with where things are manufactured of which I am once such consumer...and I'll leave it at that."", ""I'm impressed by this Thermajohn compression T-shirt. I have other name brand compression shirts and this one ranks right up there in terms of quality and construction. The material is smooth and feels comfortable during workouts. I especially like the raglan sleeves since I'm usually bothered by stitching over my shoulders. I chose a size Large and it fits quite nicely – with just about as much tightness as in the model and with enough snugness to keep things from chaffing. I'm a thin 6 foot tall 150 pounds and I wear a 42R suit jacket. I'm not a body builder and prefer long sleeve for cycling and lighter colors for visibility. The light steel grey is nice and generic enough to blend in with a variety of clothing.

My wife said too bad it didn't come with a 6pack for the shapewear part which is supposed to make me look lean and mean. There are different color options but I went with a charcoal gray looking color because it can go with pretty much anything. The shirt wicked away the sweat from my day enjoying the outdoors and was soft and comfortable to wear for long day out of the house. I would recommend this for those working out in the gym, any sport that makes you break a sweat, or even work it is stylish and comfortable and depending on the work you do you may need a comfortable shirt to wick away your sweat.

What? That\'s just crazy. So it\'s a great shirt but order carefully.', ""I have often found that compression shirts are hit and miss when it comes to correct sizing. Many are made overseas and only fit teenie tiny people, yet are marked with American sizing. I was skeptical when ordering this Thermajohn Men's Long Sleeve Compression T-Shirt, as I looked up the brand and found that it was made in China. However, when I received this shirt I was more than pleasantly amazed. The Thermajohn shirt is well made, has four-way stretch that allows for freedom of movement no matter the activity. It is definitely moisture wicking material, since I am a heavy sweater when it comes to athletics, and the shirt seemed to pull the moisture away from my skin, and allowed my skin to stay fairly dry and cool. I ordered a size larger than I generally wear in sweats and athletic clothing, because I wanted a fairly tight fit, yet not one that strangled my body uncomfortably. I was very pleased with the size that I ordered, as there is a snugness to the shirt, yet allows my blood to keep pumping. I found one stitching defect in the shirt, where it appears one spool of thread ran out, and a new one was started. It appears that this was caught at the factory and corrected, yet left blue stitching instead of the grey (yet that's being really picky). Overall, the quality of the product is excellent and well worth the package marked $39.99 price. It appears to be long lasting and well manufactured.

It\'s very impressive for the price. Seriously, this is comparable to a $100  down jacket. It\'s filled with 90% down, 10% feathers, so no synthetic fill. This makes it VERY lightweight and VERY packable. It comes with a little stuff sack to pack it into, and the 700 fill down lofts up nicely to provide a good amount of insulation for such a light jacket. \n\nI\'m a big guy, usually wear a XXXL size T-shirt, and the XXL jacket fits me almost perfectly. I can certainly wear it comfortably without noticing that it\'s ""technically"" a size too small for me.\n\nSuper stoked about this jacket', ""Glad I purchased this coat. Saved my bacon when I realized my new quilt doesn't have a draw string around the shoulders. Packs super small too. Comes with its own stuff sack but I fit it in a smaller one."", ""I went with the sky blue Because it was $10 cheaper. I'd much rather be warm than fashionable when a hiking. It was a little bit snug but not terribly uncomfortable."", 'I feel very satisficed of the coat. Warm, light and high quality material. Work very well form autumn to winter time. I will definitely buy again. 5 stars', ""When I first got it I thought it wasn't going to be warm enough. But I was very warm. Not warm enough for sustained single digit temps but for the majority of the winter, it was ma daily coat. Was that is till someone walked off with it. So evidently at least one other person agrees with me. Oh well, once it's back in stock I'll be getting a placement."", ""This might be my favorite kid's coat ever! It's thin and not bulky at all, but just as warm as a thicker coat. My son loves it! Highly recommend this one."", 'I was a bit confused by some of the reviews claiming this jacket runs small. I normally wear size 42 dress shirts and depending on particular jacket, can fall in the L or XL size. To be on the safe side, I ordered BOTH sizes . Large fits well if a bit tight. If this is to be your second layer on top of a T-shirt or light shirt, Large is the right size. If this is to be your third layer, on top of a sweater or hoodie, then you may want to go for an XL. In my case, I kept the L and returned the XL.', 'Bought this for my son to take on a backpacking trip at Philmont (New Mexico). We needed something packable, light and warm! This fit the bill perfect. We placed it in a small compression sack and packed it down to nothing. He said it was very warm and worked perfectly. He plans on using it during the year, he really likes the way it looks.', ""Ordering was very easy and shipping was very fast. This is easily my favorite jacket, it is super light and very warm when cold out. Even if it is a little warm out you don't bake in the jacket and you never feel the wind. I would definitely buy another jacket from them in the future. Great product at a great price!"", 'For the price, this jacket works well. Warm, surprisingly light. Full size zipper (as opposed to the fragile, small zipper on expensive options like patagonia). Childish and stupid brand name-just sayin. More importantly, the arm openings, at the armpit, is small and tight. Not a deal breaker but it be a major problem if hiking/moving all day. Overall, great jacket especially for the price.', 'Down jacket was exactly as shown / I am glad I ordered a size larger than I usually use / Looking forward to seeing how it performs in cold weather / LIghtweight, stuffs into bag easily / pockets do no keep hands too warm / inside pockets not sewn closed', 'I love things that can be retracted or shrunken down to a easy carry-along size, such as', ""Multi-tools etc....this down-warmy compatible stuffed in a bag coat/jacket is so easy to hide anywhere you might need it (car, luggage, etc) ...it could save your life, or at least your comfort...great quality for the price. Its quite warm. Other reviews say it runs small, but I wear a size large jacket, and this size large had room to spare ( I have no middle aged spread) and sleeves are nice and long, and I'm a lanky guy. Recommended."", 'I bought this for my son as he needed a light weight warm winter layer. It is perfect for the purpose and the bright blue around the collar gives it a little more zip than the standard puffer coat. The only reason that I did not give it five stars is that it has a very boxy fit, so that it fits well in the shoulders but is kind of loose at the weight.', 'I like everything about this jacket. I bought the Green/Purple and its color is as shown. I got tricked into thinking they ran small so I ordered the next larger size but had to return it for the advertised size. I am 73 in Charlotte,NC weighing 220 at 6 feet and it is perfect. This is a packable jacket so if you live in Minnesota this would be good in addition to a heavy coat. The jacket is truly a Down jacket with 10% feathers with a sample enclosed as opposed to some other high price Down advertised jackets that are polyester filled. You would think I work for the company but no,I am retired and need to find value and quality in my purchases. I would definitely purchase this again', 'Preface: This is the first down jacket I have ever purchased, but I do own a down sleeping bag. I was interested in trying out a down jacket, but did not want to spend upwards of $200 for one until I had a chance to try one out. I decided to purchase this jacket instead of borrow a more expensive one from friends. At first a had some reservations. I am 6 foot tall and weigh 280 pounds. I was worried that the XXL would be too small for me. Also, I would have preferred a hooded jacket and would have gladly spent $50 instead of $30 for a hooded model.', ""The color of the jacket was exactly as advertised and XXl fit me well. It is a little snug, but I like the feeling of snug from this jacket. The outer shell is very lightweight and does a good job of repelling rain. Light rain drops ball up and roll down the material easily. While one should not where a down jacket in the rain, it is good to see that it can repel water and give one the opportunity to take it off before the outer material soaks through. The inner material does a very good job of insulating. I can feel the warmth starting to build moments after zipping the jacket up. The zippers work very well both on the pockets and the main zipper. They run smooth and do not catch on the material. The only negative thing I can say about the zipper is that my beard would catch on it if the zipper is not zipped all the way up, but that is a very minor problem. I am most impressed with how the jacket handles the wind. Once zipped up the jacket feels like a cocoon of warm air surrounding your torso. While the wind does blow against the jacket, it doesn't really pierce through it. I can feel the temperature inside the jacket drop slightly, but I do not feel the wind against my skin."", 'I wore the jacket for several afternoons while I did bus duty at my middle school. It did a great job keeping me warm. The very first day I wore it I got hit with some bird crap on the right shoulder. I spot cleaned the shoulder with some paper towel and a water. The stain came off readily. If they sell a hooded model, I will definitely buy another from this brand.', 'I bought this XXL jacket for outer layer - purposely oversized to wear a sweater and vest under - perfect !!! Only disappointment is inside pockets are NOT sewn at the bottom . A good surprise the color green is darker . I also purchased a XL aqua blue , Thank You !!!! Jim', ""I really like puffer 'jackets' and have bought several different makes over the last several years. I use them in place of sweaters because of their warmth and light weight. But the Rokka&Rolla is the best I've purchased so far. Good quality, low price, good fit, and, as you'd expect, light weight and provides excellent warmth. And I love the blue color."", 'My son received this jacket today. He\'s 5\'10"" 160lbs. A medium fit him perfectly. He says its very lightweight, soft and traps heat very well. Hes going to use it hiking and it gets 5 stars for now. We will update you on how it stood the test in the mountains.', ""This jacket arrived today , and it exceeds my expectations. Many of the reviews I read before buying it warned of poor sizing, workmanship, and backward zippers. I must be lucky, because the jacket seems like a GREAT buy. The main zipper is on the correct size for a man, the arms on my XL size are a perfect length (I wear a 35''� sleeve in dress shirts) and are finished with a nice band for the wrist area. The jacket is super light but reasonably fluffy. I bought it to wear beneath a shell parka for downhill skiing. The Malibu Blue color is really pleasant, and the XL size was perfect for me (6'4''� tall, 200 lbs). The stitching seems ok although, although time will tell if it holds up. On day one it looks fine."", ""One oddity: Inside the jacket there appears to be two side pockets. Interestingly, if you put your hand all the way down these ''œpockets''� your hands go right through the pockets to air. That is, the bottom, horizontal seam of each pocket is not sewn shut! Maybe they're not supposed to be pockets, but they sure look like inside pockets!"", ""Overall, I'm thrilled at the sizing, appearance, and cost of this garment. It will not compete with a name brand high-end puffer jacket made by a high-end outdoor clothing co. , but for the AMZ price it's a no-brainer for someone looking for reasonably good jacket at a bargain price. Lucky me''”good fit, decent overall quality, and great value."", ""Not going to lie, this is by far the best purchase I have made in 2020! This puffer jacket is really lightweight so it is perfect for everyday wear and extreme activities.  That jacket is very soft and breathable so that means you're able to layer it with hoodies/shirts underneath comfortably. Durability wise, I only had this for a couple weeks, but I wore it snowboarding a couple times and it held up perfectly fine. No scratch or rips at all which was to my amazement!"", 'I love this jacket!', 'Why?', '1. For 75% of our winter in Utah it is plenty warm enough on its own.

When I got the coat, It didn't look as warm as most of my coats I have had and I thought I would shiver again. Shockingly the coat is much warmer than any other coat I have ever worn. It must have to do with the insulation. Today I took a walk in the weather that was around freezing and I thought for sure I would need another layer to keep me warm. To my shock I was covered with sweat when I got back from the walk which I have never experienced with any other coat I have worn.

When it arrived, I was somewhat doubtful. It was great material. But didn\'t seem like it would keep me warm in 0 degree weather and before 0 temps.

The coats made it through a winter season without any problems.', ""Super warm coat! It started wet snowing when I got out of work today (first day I tried it out) and this coat kept me warm and dry. The water doesn't stick to it either cause it's water resistant. I highly recommend this coat. I live in Buffalo, NY and this is by far the warmest coat I own! Better than ones I spent hundreds of dollars on. This coat is reasonable priced and super warm! Perfect for anyone looking for a solid deal on a great winter coat."", 'This coat is amazing!! The medium Fit my 6ft 157lb son great!! There was plenty of room! But if your going for a more fitted look I suggest sizing one down, its super quality and looks expensive!

GREAT QUALITY!', ""Men's Dragon Ball Z Kame Kanji House Symbol Graphic T-shirt!"", ""This shirt in my opinion is above standard, the quality is great, and the image is perfect! The image was what I was worried about when I was thinking about getting the shirt itself. Sometimes on cheaper shirts have images that are super heavy and when you wear the shirt itself, you'll find yourself totally sweating wherever the image is located, usually its because the image is caked on and thicker than any other part of the shirt. This shirt's image is perfect, its not heavy at all and you don't sweat where the image is."", ""The quality of the shirt itself is awesome in my opinion and its just right as far as being the perfect blend of cloth, its not heavy and its not to light, it's just right and perfect for a summer shirt, or under shirt in the winter if you're layering up. The image itself stands for Dragon Ball Z which is a sort of anime cartoon and seems to be really popular with the kids these days."", 'Overall:', ""I love the shirt, its perfect in the cloth's weight. The shirt itself to me is a above average shirt in quality and the image is perfectly balanced, not causing sweat or any discomfort when wearing it in the hot house or on a hot summer day. I would recommend this shirt to anyone at all! Highly Recommended!"", ""This is a very comfortable cotton shirt for every day wear. The shirt is made in Honduras and it is 100% cotton. The fit is relaxed. Size M is marked to fit sizes 38-40. I'm 5'6” and about 170 lbs right now. I had a baby last month and I am all about comfort and loose fit and this shirt is great for both. It is soft and machine washable. I love the fact that there are no tags. My husband likes Dragon Ball Z but he is not familiar with the print on this particular shirt. I like the contrast of white and red on black background. The emblem is designed to look slightly distressed and it looks like it will wear down nicely as the time goes on. Emblem is made of the rubbery type of material that reminds me of the type that you iron onto the fabric. I like the vintage look of it and how comfortable it is. It is a good shirt for chilling around the house, working out or even running errands. The fit is definitely unisex but on a looser side so if you like your t-shirts to be more fitted buy a size lower than your actual size."", ""This men's t-shirt is, I think, really well made. It is very soft and has a crew neck which I much rather prefer to the v-neck style t-shirts. It is made of a cotton and polyester blend. This keeps it from shrinking the way 100% cotton would do if dried in a dryer. I like the bright coloring and I think that the screen printing should last through many washings. The big test usually for most shirts is how the graphic holds up under drying. A lot of times the graphic will start to peel or bubble. So far this has not happened with this shirt. I am not a huge fan of anime but I have heard of Dragon Ball Z and my grandson was impressed when I showed him that I got this t-shirt."", ""I like the symbol on the front of the shirt it reminds me of loved ones I have from Japan even though I don't know much about the Dragon Ball Z Franchise I do know this is the ancient scripture for Japanese writing and that I like. The shirt is made of a nice soft 100% cotton material and will go nicely with my orange sweatshirt I just bought."", 'The feel of the fabric is nice and soft. The color of the graphic was good and a fun design. My husband liked the fit. It washed and dried without shrinking. I would definitely recommend checking out this T shirt line if you are in the market for one.', 'I received the Dragon Bail Kanji House symbol shirt a couple of days ago. I ordered it for my son from the Walmart Spark Reviewer program.', ""The fabric of the t-shirt is a good quality shirt. Not too heavy but not too thin either. The screen print design is rather large covering almost the whole width of the t-shirt. The design is only a white background with a red symbol. I'm not sure if the manufacturer meant to have the ink of the printed design to not be totally solid or not. It is not, if the shirt was printed this way on purpose for me it looks more like a defect in the screen printing process. Aside from this issue for me I think the design is very nice and so does my son."", ""The only size available was a medium. My son is a smaller statured size so the medium is a little large. Still looks fine on and him he likes the shirt. Seems like most people like to wear oversized t-shirts nowadays anyway. The t-shirt is made of 100% cotton. It's hard to tell how much a garment will shrink when it's 100% cotton. I found that when you want them to shrink they don't and vice versa. The t-shirt washed well and did not shrink much. I forgot to measure it before washing as I've done with other clothing in the past. However the shirt is still a little big which is why I say it didn't shrink much."", ""This Men's Dragon Ball Z Kame Kanji House Symbol Graphic T-shirt picked or my son which is right up his personal taste since he likes gaming and Dragon Ball Z. The fit, size, color, construction and printed design is fine. The fabric held up well during wash and drying with really not much shrinkage at all so fit stayed the same also fabric remained soft. The seams and how it was made is good. Son really like logo since seems old world and likes the game. The length was particularly great on Men's Dragon Ball Z Kame Kanji House Symbol Graphic T-shirt as my son is long on the torso so length was perfect for him. Overall the Men's Dragon Ball Z Kame Kanji House Symbol Graphic T-shirt is good and looks great on!"", ""The Men's Dragon Ball Z Kame Kanji House Symbol Graphic T-shirt looks good, fit well, black color and logo is nice.

It is light and fresh. Size M is somewhat wide but shrinks a little after washing.', 'It is a mixture of cotton and polyester, the neck is round.', 'My son has watched all the Dragon Ball series since he was a child, so he was excited.', 'It can be a detail for a person who likes Dragon Ball Z', ""The Dragon ball Z Men's t-shirt is 100% cotton. The size medium 38/40 is a good true medium and is a crew neck. It is a nice thickness, and not too thin, so I think it will last a long time. It is machine in cold water and tumble dry low. Do not iron or dry clean because of the silkscreen printed house logo. I love the logo, but I think the print was not done properly because there are a lot of black speckles on the white background and it is very noticeable. It gives the logo an old worn look, which is fine, but I do not think it is supposed to be that way. I tried washing it to see if the speckles come off, thinking it is lint from the black shirt, but to no avail. The speckles are still there. I must point out that this black stuff is not because the white print has rubbed off or cracked in any way. I still like this shirt, but I would hesitate to gift it because of the flaws. I always turn t-shirts inside out to wash so the logo prints will last longer as well. A good feature is that this t-shirt is tagless, as well."", ""Well son liked shirt, it's black and he's a gamer so what can I say! The Men's Dragon Ball Z Kame Kanji House Symbol Graphic T-Shirt wore well as expected and no stretching on neckline some others do. The shirt fabric is a bit light so good for warmer weather like here in Florida. It washed well, didn't notice lot of shrinkage and so far no color fading. It had the normal wrinkles you expect of a t-shirt coming out of the dryer so nothing unusual about that. The construction and sewing on it is good. Son like the worn out logo look like it's design. The shirt fit was spot on like my son like wearing his shirts and specially on the lengthwise since his torso is long. Well son is ok with the shirt and is fine wearing and looks good so thumbs up on this t-shirt.""]",men's clothing,1

I live in Canada and most of the time,  I go outside, I have no need to turn the heat on as long as the weather doesn't dip below zero. When it does, I typically use the hottest setting. I often don't wear anything bulky under my coat and the jacket keeps me toasty even when I wear a light sweater. I wish the jacket had a warmer setting because the maximum setting is not as warm as I prefer.  I work outside some days and the jacket keeps me warm. I have no need to stuff my coat pockets with heat packs like some of my coworkers. I do not feel hot when the jacket is set at at its highest heat setting - I am comfortable.  I tend to use a lower heat setting when I step on transit or step inside. The jackets price is good value. I would rather buy another Ororo jacket over a ridiculously expensive unethical Canada Goose jacket.  Plus, you don't need to over extend yourself financially to make a fashion statement because my coworkers noticed my heated jacket immediately when they noticed the button light when I powered it on. I prefer if the power button did not light up because I don't like drawing attention to my heated jacket.  Anyway,  it's a great investment.

So I am probably not the best guy to review a compression shirt, but I have to say that wearing it, while doing my activities, seemed to give me more endurance, and I definitely did not get tired as quickly as usual. I fits great, and even helps hold in my belly. I like how it makes my biceps look better, and it definitely kept me feeling dryer, when I was sweating. As for helping me after a workout, I probably do not work out hard enough to see, feel, or notice those benefits, but if it might be helping, then I will keep wearing it. So if you are looking for a compression t-shirt, I recommend giving the Thermajohn Men Short Sleeve Baselayer Cool Dry Compression T-Shirt a try.', ""The Thermajohn Men Short Sleeve Baselayer Cool Dry Compression T-Shirt for Athletic Workout and Running fits true to size, is fairly long in the torso making it easy to tuck in, and has good sleeve lengths and a comfortable collar. The material is thin but you can tell it's strong. I have no complaints about this shirt and think it lives up to what Thermajohn advertises. Recommended!"", ""I found this shirt to be a nice lightweight shirt. The shirt is form fitting, I got mine oversized but almost wish I hadn't. the material is very breathable and makes for a great shirt to wear when involved in physical activity or in very warm weather. It can be used as a baselayer or it is fashionable enough to wear by itself as an outer layer. I found it to keep me cooler and dryer then most of my other apparel. The light gray color is nice if out in the sun it is not absorbing the heat from the sun as do many darker colors. Almost immediately the letter from the logo started pealing but this has no effect on the quality of the shirt."", ""I needed a new exercise/workout shirt so I tried the Thermajohn Men Short Sleeve Baselayer Cool Dry Compression T-Shirt for Athletic Workout and Running. It is a nice looking shirt and the material is soft and flexible. It doesn't stretch at all. I guess if your really thin and in shape this would be a good choice. However, I am 5'9 and 225 pounds. I wear 2X shirts. It came in 2X so I got it. When I put the shirt on it was really tight like a medium and it was not comfortable. I want to be able to breathe while I am exercising! I would have to be 50lbs lighter to fit comfortably in the shirt. I received the product from the Spark Reviewer program."", 'This shirt is made with high quality and looks and feels good. Wicks the sweat away so your not staying wet from all that sweat all the time. Feels very comfortable and made with quality materials. If your looking for a everyday workout shirt or something to throw on to work out in the garden, you need to try. I reccomend it and you wont be disappointed. Thanks for a great product', 'Thermajohn compression shirt. Size (length=28""), (Shoulder to shoulder=16.5""), (Sleeve length=6.5) inch for a medium size. 87% Polyester/ 13% Elastic Jersey made in China. The elasticity Will stretch to your body form and looks nice as long as you don\'t a have beer belly for when you\'re at the gym or casual. It. keeps you cool by pulling away the sweat. The reason I\'m giving it 3 stars is the small part of the stitching on the shoulder is blue but the rest are white. Did they run out of white and finished it off with blue?

But I\'m hoping that the fit will be better. \n\nQuality wise, they seem very great. Stretchy enough to be comfy, thick enough to not easily tear or be see through.

By at least an inch or more in the waist. I almost thought I should keep them, but decided I\'d still prefer a snugger fit.

I wear sports bras often and in this heat it gets Mighty hot because they get squished together so I have to put a lot of baby powder there but with this bra I don't have to put so much baby powder to keep dry because this bra still separates.

Great dress, just buy a smaller size than you traditionally wear.', 'This is a beautiful dress in the color of Red, you can dress it up or dress it down. The material is thick and would be great for all year around. I put on a pair of leggins with a pair of low cut boot heels. The dress is suppose to fir at the waist line and flare out at the bottom. I am 5\'4 and 105lbs. The dress is a tad bit big for me being an extra small. There was about 2"" inches lose on both sides. The dress came right to my knees and the shoulder\'s fit perfect. I plan on having it altered to fit better around my waistline. I would order a size smaller than your normal size. I was hoping that the XS would fit me. The color is a true red, I will use this dress for going out and everyday wear. It is appropriate for work in the office. It has a zipper from the back of your neck to your waistline, easy to zip and unzip. It has a cute little gold button on both sides of the sleeves. This dress is machine washable. However, I do recommend laying it flat to dry. I love the style and the bottom flare out look. The neckline is perfect too! It isn\'t to low or feel that it is choking me. The only reason I give this beautiful little Red dress 4 stars, it fits like maybe a medium in an Extra small. I am right at 25 inches in the waist. Other than that it is a perfect dress that don\'t look cheap ad the quality is made with love. I have attached two photos of me wearing the dress and how lose it is around my waistline. If you normally wear a medium, go with a size small. Please see photos.', ""The dress is beautiful. It's classy looking. Heavier fabric than I expected. This is a good thing as it's very well made. It will keep me warm in cold weather. It is very well crafted. Seams are sturdy. The color is bright, brighter than the pics show. It's a true red. It made me think power. It has little buttons on the sleeve to dress it up so it doesn't look severe. It's the kind of dress that you can dress up, and be flashy or leave it simple and elegant. It's easy to take care of. Simple enough for church, dressy enough for the office."", 'The color red is very pretty BUT the fabric is too thick, the dress is too boxy and it is not a good dress', ""This is got to be one of the squarest and ugliest dresses I've ever seen. It does absolutely nothing to flatter your shape. I wear an xlarge but this dress is way over sized For an Xlarge. It is very plain and outdated. If the color of it was black, it would look like something somebody would wear when they are in mourning. Although the fabric is nice and seems to be of good qualify, it will still be a dress that I will not wear since it is too big and too dated for my age range. So unless you have a funeral to go to, I suggest looking for a different dress."", ""I am normally size L but these fit like XL.

I dont care about the style or how they look as a fashion statement but for my personal opinion they work perfect for me. They also have pockets so I can slip my phone and keys in and not forget to grab when I leave my workplace.

I give 5 stars for these reasons.', ""Great pants. Inseam is perfect, waist sits where is it supposed to. They stay up so the crotch isn't at my knee.

I would also like to see more colors in this style."", ""These are perfect for the office or running around, they are a sturdy weight, dressier looking than the denim choices and wash well. Going by the size guide I ordered the 3x, the waist is just a bit larger than I need but not so large that it's obvious under my shirts. Hopefully, they'll shrink a little?

Can't beat this price, either."", ""How do they do it? It's like they're tailored (3X petite) hem, sizing - they're perfect.

I love that there's room where it's needed - the front and rear and the thighs but it's slight so they don't look messy just appropriate. Thanks JMS and Walmart - helps to know when I need close at whatever size, there's still somewhere fair to turn  - just because one is big (temporarily or not) doesn't mean we don't need stylish, on trend, clean, neat options (enough with the crazy prints and square cuts like we don't have dimensions!!!!) Thanks again"", 'These are my absolute first choice for wearing around the house, especially for cleaning or yard work, because they are very comfortable and not tight.  They are also very durable.

For that I buy super stretchy ""skinny"" jeans.', ""Excellent jeans! For those of us who don't want jeggings or other similar products, they are just right. They are true to size, are nice material, have pockets and a comfortable waist band. The legs are not too wide or too clingy. Pockets too. Perfect for me! Please don't ever discontinue these. I highly recommend them. This is my third pair. JMS ... take note...

The leg of the leggings was stretchy and comfortable and I probably would've rated these 5 stars if it wasn't for the odd fit of the waistband. The waistband isn't stretchy and is constricting to the point I couldn't get these over my hips. My waist is 27 inches and hips are 40 inches. If you have a small waist compared to your hips and want the waistband to be tight around your waste then DO NOT BUY THESE!!! If I bought a medium or even a large to be able to get the waistband over my hips then these would've been gaping and big around my waste. Normally when people say something is small and I buy the item for myself, I find that its true to size and that people must be lying to themselves about their size. But in this case, they are truly small because the waistband has no stretch. I would only recommend these for people that don't have a huge difference in the size of their hips and waist."", 'They were okay...Fit small']",women's clothing,1

I weighed 117 lb pre-pregnancy and now I'm around 138 lbs in week 30 (but still with a small frame - I'm carrying all in the front), and these fit me as I would expect. There is a little bagginess in the waist area, but most maternity pants/bottoms I have seem to be this way to allow expansion as your bump grows.\n\nThe biggest pro for me is the value of these - I couldn't find a 2-pack for this price anywhere else. Most places price one pair at this price, and since I'm basically living in leggings right now, I need multiple pairs. The color and opaqueness is about what you would expect from any standard pair of cotton leggings. I'm satisfied with it!\n\nThe biggest con for me would probably be the bump panel/waistband. I do prefer the bump panels to be that more spandexy material, but again, these were such a good price. I have a really nice pair of leggings with the panel material I like and they were probably more like $20-$25 for one pair. The elastic waistband is kind of weird. It's thicker and bunchier than most panel waistbands, so it's not as comfortable, but I have some belly bands I like to wear for the tight support feeling, so I wear one of those under this panel and it provides me with the supportive feeling I like and makes the waistband substantially less noticeable and substantially more comfortable.\n\nOverall, don't expect a super high quality pair of leggings when you order these - they're only like $7.50 each! Go into the purchase expecting a very standard pair of cotton leggings and you will be satisfied! If you want a really nice pair and are okay with spending more, go for it! If you want a few more bump-friendly bottoms to wear without having to spend a ton on clothes you'll only wear in certain phases of your life (like me!), these are a perfect option for you!"", ""I'd rather wear sweatpants lol but they're good for if I want to look nice.\nThe band on the belly is a little uncomfortable but not awful. Would be better if it was a wide smooth band, but it's narrow and sort of bunched up. The material is nice. They are kinda see through if you bend over really far.

If you are shorter, like ankle jeans or a cropped look, then go ahead and buy them.

However, you cannot wear these with a shoe that comes low on your foot such as flats or loafers because it will look like high waters on anyone who is taller than about 5 foot 4. \nThe jeans are a nice wash, they come up to the natural waist. I found the fit to be tight but also loose - I wasnt sure if a size up or down wouldve helped! Im 128lbs, I ordered a size 26 but it wasnt as tight in the waist and butt as I expected. Although, at the same time I found that the zipper was very... weak to be tasked with holding you into stiff denim jeans! The zipper slid down twice when I was trying it on which would be very embarrassing in public, perhaps the quality is not very robust and strong.

The only option for her is to wear a long sleeve solid black shirt under. They arrived and the material was a light waffle type. I thought it might be see through because its light weight but it didn’t show any signs of see through once on. Unfortunately the arms were very strange. They are super tight but its loose on other places. Her arms are not big at all, they are regular to small ish sized. She wears a Medium consistently. Normally the problem area for her is the chest section is where she struggles but that was a great generous fit, but the arms were so tight she couldn’t get them all the way up to her armpit and weren’t appearing to stretch. She still tried it. The shirt absorbed moisture when she was sweating when things heated up. She didn’t feel the sweat like she did with a different style shirt she tried. We are going to wash it and try again to see if the arms loosen up a bit. If they don’t, she will not be able to wear because she said the tightness was distracting especially when she bent her arms.', 'Fruit of the Loom Waffle Thermal tops are not scratchy on my skin.

This is a great buy for the price an your getting close to a V.S. bra no kidding."", ""I have bought these bras for years. They were Dream Fit. They sold a back smoother and a t-shirt type. They just married the two for this Secret Treasure one. I overall love the fit. I buy one cup smaller though, otherwise it's too big. I like the coverage, and the straps do not dig into my shoulders. Bonus! My biggest issue is the underwire. Looking at my purchase history, I have bought 22 of these bras in 4 years! And the reason being, the underwire either snaps in two on the right side, or the underwire pokes through the ends on either the inside or outside. I literally have a graveyard of useless bras due to the underwire! I cannot find a customer service number for Secret Treasures to ask them about it, and Walmart customer service was nice enough to give me a promo code, but I have to spend $45 to get a $25 credit. My most recent purchase was on May 20th. After wearing 11 times, I alternate to wash, the underwire snapped on me today!! I can't seem to find anything that fits better, and when I try to sew the unbroken underwires back into the bra, the thread rubs me uncomfortably."", 'the underwire does not come up to the edge of the babd therefore  it sticks into the breast. the tag next to the hook and eyes is stiff and constantly scratcging you back.

So when I purchased these they fit and are very comfortable.  I was delighted with the shape these gave me as well as the price.  I have a lot of side budge which this keeps in check quite well.  I haven't had to pull and tug all day like my previous bras., and the straps are wide and a bit padded to prevent digging.  These give me a nice shape to my girls, and I think this bra is simple yet pretty, providing smooth lines under my clothes."", ""Love the way this bra fits!\n\nI was really happy to find that this is a proper FF bra, designed for busty women, rather than just an infuriating dainty design made for an A-cup but scaled up to a DDD.  Wide, padded shoulder straps, wide wings to cut down on the side-boob, a three hook closure, underwires and foam cups to prevent the dreaded uni-boob... Well done!\n\nEven though the fabric is pretty basic, it's actually quite pretty -- there's a lacy mesh stretched over the satin fabric, giving it subtle texture, but not enough to show up through clothes. \n\nWill definitely buy more of these! For the price it can't be beat!"", 'The straps are so comfortable for a 42DDD and a perfect fit.', 'Comfortable for my large breasts.

It would be comfortable with the fabric but the support is flimsy to me. The bounce test was a fail. Too much shifting for the girls.', ""Absolutely LOVE this bra. Was skeptical buying online without a fitting session. Fits perfectly and I'm buying two more today. Nice bargain for a great bra."", 'I really like this bra. I find the fit and comfort to be perfect. The problem I had is that after 2 months, the underwire on the right side snapped and broke. I have ordered the same exact bra because of how comfortable it is. Time will tell of the underwire is an issue with the new bra.', ""For a full-figured woman, support and comfort are not always easy to find in the same bra. The Secret Treasures Women's Full Figure Underwire T-Shirt Bra is the most comfortable bra I've found with this level of support. The underwires tend to break, but not so soon that it makes the bra a bad purchase. I've purchased at least four of these, and I'm wearing one now. The best thing I can say about a bra is I would rather wear it than go without, and I can say that of this one. The elastic is as comfortable as it can be and still support, the straps don't dig into my shoulders too much, and the cups are soft with no seams. The reason I bought this bra the first time was the reasonable price. The prices for bras for busty women can be fairly prohibitive, so when I saw this it seemed logical to give it a chance. I'm so glad I did. Good-bye, $50 bras!""]",women's clothing,0

I love the material, it is soft and non - binding. I love the extra coverage on the sides and back that it provides.

It doesn't roll down and let the back fat spill over for me like other bras that have the stays and are stiffer materials. The cups are not too thick or bulky like some of the foam cups can be and they are a great fit. Not too low or too high cut and I think will work well with most necklines, unless you are wearing a super deep plunging one. The straps are stretchy but not too stretchy and are adjustable to create a perfect fit for anyone.\n\nIt's proportioned in such a way that it is an excellent bra for any figure, from full figure to petite I think it is an all-around good fit.\nAll and all a great bra!"", ""I normally wear Warners bras. Style 1593 in size 34C and it's an almost perfect fit. It is a full coverage padded underwire bra (which I really needed 5 years after having a baby…let's just say the girls weren't as perky as they were before having a child and breast feeding). While I don't usually have an underarm pudge problem I do find it really hard to find a bra that fits me just right. A demi bra fits me well in the underarm area but I need full coverage otherwise the girls flop out when I bend over and most full coverage bras come up too high in the underarm area and cut me at the armpits.\n\nI ordered The Warners Blissful Benefits Underarm Smoothing bra (size 34C nude color). The color was perfect and blended nicely with my skin so you couldn't see it through a thin white t-shirt. It provided ample coverage. The underwire was comfortable and the cup size was right on target. For me the padding was a little thin but I am used to a heavily padded bra. Even so the Blissful Benefits did its job and did it well. The underarm smoothing feature was a really nice perk. Unfortunately it was a little too high for me. I think it would be a great feature for someone that finds a general full coverage bra fits well. While I am normally a 34 I think I could have used a 32 in this bra because I found it was a little loose and tended to slide around during the course of the day. I've worn the bra twice and washed it twice (I put it in the wash machine in a delicate bag with my other bras on the delicate cycle and it came out fine). All things considered I'd recommend this bra to someone else but I don't think I'd purchase it for myself because it wasn't the perfect fit for me. I'm 5'4” tall & 135 lbs.

After washing one a couple times, I did not see any obvious shrinking or fading compared to its unwashed twin from this 2-pack (black, size L), even though I dried it on medium heat, against the instructions.

Can't wait for the fall season! Highly Recommend!"", ""I received a free pair of Time and Tru  Zipper Bootie (brown) to try out , review and keep on behalf of the Walmart Spark program.  Because I love absolutely everything about them, I immediately ordered the same pair but in black.  I live in jeans and boots throughout fall, winter and early spring.  That means I need boots that fit and feel great on my feet and hold up well as they'll be worn 6 months straight. I'm not a fan of high heeled anything. lol.  These boots have a nice, roughly 2 inch heel to them.  Perfect for me! The design is pretty simple and basic-nothing super fancy. I like this as well.  Each bootie has a zipper on the outer part of the boot which is easy to zip and unzip without issue. Because I have wide feet and high arches, I did order the wide width boots. I highly recommend you do the same if you have similar feet issues.  For me, the best part about Time and Tru is the fabulous memory foam insoles.  Not only do they provide wonderful support for my feet, they feel FANTASTIC! The booties are very well made also. Precise and strong stitching, no scuffs or marks of any kind. The day my brown booties arrived, I wore them around the house to test them for my review.  My feet felt wonderful. They were comfortable the entire time I had the boots on. (I did wear them for a significant amount of time!) My feet did not become sore, tired or achy at all.  I knew these were the boots for me and immediately ordered a pair in black as well.  And the price of these gems can't be beat! If you're in need of some VERY comfortable booties that look awesome with jeans or dress pants, you're going to want to give Time and Tru a try.  Your feet will not only look great, they'll FEEL great too!"", ""If you're looking for a pair of basic booties that will go with almost anything but still have a flair for on-point fashion, these shoes are a great fit for you. The zipper on the outside of the shoe, rather than the more typical zipper near the inside ankle, helps the look of these booties to stand out from the crowd. Having the zipper on the opposite side of the shoe may play tricks with your muscle memory when you first put the shoe on, so they're not quite slip-on and go, but it's well worth the trade off. These booties are comfortable, but they do run a bit narrow. Overall, these are a great addition to my wardrobe."", ""My feet are about a size 7 1/2. But my lower body is paralyzed, making it difficult to get certain styles of shoes on my feet, so I generally have to order a size 8. I have trouble especially with boots of any kind. So when I ordered these booties in Size 7, I fully expected that I wouldn't be able to wear them and I'd have to give them to my daughter (which would have been fine, as she likes them, too). Still, out of an undying hope I might finally find a bootie I can wear, I tried them on as soon as they arrived. Holy moly! THEY FIT!! And beautifully, too! So then I took a really good look at them. They are really nice boots with a zipper on the side. (Note: the zipper is on the outside of this boot rather than the inside.) The stitching is good, the color is matte, the insole is made of memory foam, and the soles are non-skid. The zipper slides up and down smoothly enough and has a short leather pull to help. These booties will go with so many looks, but I will be wearing them with leggings and a tunic as my autumnal uniform!"", ""I guess it's the wide fit that makes it possible for me to get my feet into these booties, but I suspect they might run a bit large, anyway, so order with that in mind. Overall, I am really impressed with the quality and look of these booties. If I could change one thing, it might be that I'd prefer the zipper to be on the *inside* (as in, the inner ankle part) so as to leave a smoother look on the more visible part of the boot. But the zipper looks good, too, so that is a very minor thing. I really love these booties, and I can't wait to start wearing them all the time this fall!"", ""Overall, I like the boots. They will be a nice addition to my fall and winter wardrobe. It's currently summer and I could not wear these all day. This review is based on wearing the boots for about 30 minutes at a time wow walking around my home. Minus one star because the shoe lacks an appropriate cushioned insert."", 'In my opinion, the boots are stylish. I always purchase boots one size larger. These Boots are in 11 wide and they fit my foot perfectly. May have issues when I attempt to wear these with thicker socks but I have not tried it yet. I think these boots are a solid bet for occasional wear in the upcoming season.', 'The color is a nice, cognac brown.', ""These shoes are made well. When I first got them, the first thing that stood out to me was it's weight. These are not made from the consistent cheap material that you see most shoes being made from now a days. It looks sleek. I love that the shoe was very spacious. As soon as my daughter saw the shoes, she said I want them. She's 17 years old. I thought these were like $30-$40, but they left the price tag on them and boy was I shocked. For less than $15, this is for sure a steal. I'm a huge Walmart shopper, I've not seen this quality for this price at all."", ""These booties are pretty cute. I ordered a 8W, and sometimes it just depends on the shoe if it will fit right or not. I also tried it without socks on so that could have played a part in this, but the shoes were a bit big on me. Nothing terrible. They were comfortable. I like the way they feel. The leather is soft. I love the zipper side, that adds the bit of flare they were missing. I'd like to try these with a pair of jeans on to see how they look. I'm not a huge fan of pointed toe shoes, and they're not exactly pointed in my opinion, more pointed/rounded, but still I would've preferred more round tip. They are cute though overall. If they had a gray suede version I would like them a lot more. Like I said though, they are comfortable when you walk, they are not too high, and I would give them an 8 out of 10 if I could. I believe if you like booties, then you will like these."", 'These are super cute zipper half boots in a lovely taupe color. I usually wear a seven and a half and sometimes an eight. I got theses online in a seven and a half but would probably prefer them a half size larger to an eight. Unfortunately, I do not see them in the store so I am not sure that I will pursue exchanging the size. The toe area comes too much to a point and squishes my toes uncomfortably. I have yet to walk in them all day and only have briefly tried them on. I tried them on with some lightweight socks as I would usually wear with half boots. I was pleasantly surprised, however, to find that there was a pretty good support for my arch. This has been a constant difficulty to find in any shoe and would seem to me to be a fantastic benefit of this half boot. The boot zips on the outside of the leg which is fantastic and so the zippers will not bang against each other as you walk. The zippers showcase a cute, decorative tassel which can aid in pulling the zipper up and down. The taupe color is great because of how it can basically match everything and anything. There is a soft, pho, brushed leather material constructing the outside of the half boot. With other shoes I have had with a similar material I find it can be scratched easily but with these boots I can run my fingernails across the surface and can see no scratch at all. These half boots also come with a memory foam on the bottom which actually provides great comfort. I have found that time and true products are a fantastic quality and are among my favorite pieces to wear.', 'I loved these boots. They look good after wearing and great for autumn and winter wear.

I love the look. They are very trendy. I can also appreciate how low to the ground they are. That will help to make them much more comfortable to walk in. Even though they are low heeled they still look very nice and fashionable. I can tell they are not leather though. They have more of the cheaper look but they're still nice nonetheless. I really like the line of the shoe around the ankle. It's not a straight line so it adds to the design making it look even nicer. The inside of the shoe says memory foam so that's always a plus. It helps to have comfortable shoes as there were no sharp or rough edges squeezing my feet. overall these are pretty nice shoes and I would recommend."", 'I received the Time and True Zipper Booties.', ""They are so cute.

Nice stylish bootie that goes with almost everything"", ""I love the color of these brown boots and they are so comfortable! They go well with any color jeans, imo. They run true to size and I needed to get the wide, which is great for my foot. The heel is the perfect height for walking around at work or out shopping. They look nice. The only thing I find odd is that the zipper is on the outer side of the boot rather than on the inside. On all of my other boots, the zippers touch when my feet are together.

I wore them all day at work and my feet never hurt. I even wore them while shopping and never once had any foot pain.', 'I really like the look and feel of these boots. You can definitely tell that they are very well made and very durable. The rubber bottoms have ridges which makes me feel comfortable enough to walk in water or on a slippery surface.

The problem is the strap design.  The straps are no longer made of a stretchy, satin-ribbon type elastic with the raw ends tucked under.  Instead they are made of a stiff fabric that is sewn to a small amount of smooth elastic in the back.  The raw edges overlap around the top of the shoulder blade and irritate the skin. By the end of the day, I had sore areas on my collar bone, the top of my shoulders and my back where the elastic and bra fabrics overlap.  You don't notice this when you try the bra on in the store, but by the end of the day you can be miserable.  The straps are fabric wrapped with bias cut strips, which are then serged.  All of these layers are against your skin and can be very irritating.   Also, for some reason they moved the strap adjusters to the back so that you have to slip it off to guess what would be the right size, then try it on and repeat until you get it right.  I still love Hanes and plan to try their bras again when the strap design is changed.  Remember, dear Hanes, customers would rather pay a tiny bit more for quality than end up with something unwearable cluttering their closets."", ""Even at their longest, the straps are too short.  The cups are weird, kind of pointy.  I've had this bra for over a year and I've only worn it maybe four or five times.  It's very uncomfortable, and I find myself yanking at the band to try and pull it down all the time."", ""I've always had a problem with many of my bras, either the cup is too big too little or the waistband is too loose or tight. I figured let me try these because they looked very comfortable. I'm glad I did !! This is the best fitting bra for me. It's super comfortable, covers me entirely also love the shape it gives me with my shirts on. Will definitely buy me a few more. Thanks"", ""They are made well and fit as expected.  I wish they were made with a better fabric that could stand up to use.....because the only problem I have is that the fabric pills after wearing several times from rubbing against other clothing and body parts.  You have to carefully use a tiny scissors and carefully remove each pill.  You can't use a clothing shaver to remove as it will cause a hole in the fabric.  I always hand wash and dry so that's not the issue and I only wear them 2 times before wearing another one so with that - they are well cared for with my use.  They are comfortable to wear as well.  I've tried to add a photo as the option is there but it won't highlight so I can add one."", ""I am not enamored of the straps or the fact that I ordered a band size that should have been WAY bigger than the bras I already own, but, isn't. It is somewhat bigger, but .. I am guessing this company sizes the band to be exactly so when on the last hooks before the end, instead of the middle or other end, like more generous companies do. Also, the band has very little stretch as do the straps. Which could be a good or bad thing, depending on what you expect when you purchase them. For me, big shouldered and overweight, the straps at their loosest setting barely get over my shoulders and do what needs to be done.  All that being said, despite the straps and band being tighter and less giving than expected, I am sitting here  wearing a bra for the first time in weeks and feeling almost perfectly comfortable.  I'd be annoyed more if I hadn't gotten them so cheap, but for the price they are pretty darned nice! You'll pardon me for not adding photos!"", ""There is a plastic-like material used surrounding the area of the bra where the beat would test that is uncomfortably irritating to my skin.

It is longer than I expected, but I think I also could have worn a size smaller, so that's probably why.

My husband jokingly suggested I was doing a Madonna impersonation. The shoulder straps are great, wide enough to give good support without cutting into the skin. The size runs true for the aoubd the body measurement and cup size.. except for the awkward seam.. I did try adjusting it and tugging to flatten and it would for a little while and then...

It was a little hard to get used to. The top was absolutely not what I was expecting. It's also 100% polyester, but it is as poofy as a cloud. I've had blankets like this before, but this was a full on sweater. My first impression after putting it on is that it would have been a lot cozier if it were bigger. It's not long at all and was a big snug, not as true to size as the pants. With some more room to move I might have enjoyed it better. I also know from experience that this type of super soft cushy fabric hangs really easily on everything, so I think anyone with any dry skin issues would be absolutely miserable wearing this, it will hang up and scrape any dry skin on your hands and upper body. I attached a picture of the inside of the shirt, it's not quite as poofy inside but has a lot of the same feel. The shirt also has the cuff on the end of the sleeves, keeping it tighter to your wrists without any flow. All in all with the size and features I did not feel cozy, I felt a little like I was trapped.

I love wearing leggings. That is most of my pants in my closet. Because I wear leggings so much, I have become quite picky with the materials. Leggings I wear has to be soft, cannot be see through, for the summer ones, can't be too hot when I wear them and for winter ones, has to be able to keep me warm. I am trying out the Women's Plus Size High Waisted 2-Pack Fleece Lined Athleisure Leggings. First thing I noticed is that it is pretty thick, which means I probably cannot wear it during the summer seasons, but seems perfect for winter weather. It also feels really soft. It is lined with fleece which is probably why it is so soft. I am sure the thickness and softness will keep me warm and comfortable during the winter months. Another thing I really like is the quality of the material. I was able to really stretch the material, but it still cannot see through. I posted a photo of the pants really stretched out to show the quality of it. I tried it out and no doubt it was really soft, stretchy, comfortable and kept me really warm. I like that it is plain black so I can match with pretty much any color top. It works well with most occasions depending on the top I match it with which makes it so versatile."", 'These are the best leggings ever, especially for cold days! They are thick, and very very comfortable. I really like the high-waisted style because of my stomach area. I usually wear a large in leggings and these are 1X/2x and they fit perfectly. I assume they run somewhat small..which is ok by me! I will be buying these leggings!!', 'I wear a size 22-24 so I ordered the 3X. They do fit however, you have to put them on like pantyhose with the amount of compression these things have. They are warm enough for a Texas winter so far. They do show EVERY curve and bump and are great at sucking in the tummy some too.', 'Yes, I fit that stay at home mom stereotype. I live in leggings! With two small children I am busy all day every day. These are so easy to throw on and do house work or school drop off/pick up for my oldest. They also work for running errands. I also try to go running when I can arrange for someone to watch the baby. These are great for running in the chilly Fall weather. They are so warm and so comfy! They are also flattering to a mom with some extra baby weight still hanging around. I pair them with my favorite Fall cardigan and they are perfect. Also great for wearing under dresses in cool weather. I think they are mostly true to size but I would size up if in doubt. Definitely recommend and I will be getting more! They are a staple for me!', ""These leggings are so comfortable. With leggings they come in different textures. These leggings are lined. Making it comfortable to wear during the cold winter days. These leggings don't itch and they feel amazing. I would definitely recommend these leggings"", 'So I was pretty excited about these pants. I am all about high waisted pants and like that I can also turn down the extra tall part of the pants if I want to. I was very curious about the “fleece lined” and how exactly that would work with leggings. But they are athleisure so I went with it. I was pleasantly surprised in that they were not fleece lined as I was thinking they might be- I thought there might be fuzzy type material inside that would make them super thick. I think my other leggings are much thinner but not so much that these were too thick. They were like one more layer of super thick tights; definitely thicker than most leggings but not so thick you would feel like you are wearing pajama pants. And, of course, the value is amazing and two packs are always amazing. I strongly suggest you err on the side of getting a bigger size- they most certainly run a little small size wise. In fact, the drawbacks or negatives for these leggings were that they are a little hard to get on due to the thickness (again, think of very thick tights) and they were not roomy enough (for me) in the seat. Everywhere else was fine (thighs, lower legs, tummy)- but the bum was a little too tight for me. I do like these but do suggest ordering on the bigger side for your size.', ""I was a little concerned that these fleece leggings would not fit me, despite getting the correct size. Although they were rather tricky to get them precisely placed, once they were on, they are extremely comfortable. To explain what I mean, the groin region was the area I had problems with. It was almost like trying to get into a really tight fitting pair of jeans. But in order to not have a lot of unflattering space between my groin and thighs, it did require a bit of wiggling and pulling to get these leggings where they needed to be. These are extremely form fitting leggings, so I know that I will only be wearing these around the house or under clothing. I honestly feel like these would be the perfect leggings to wear under clothing to join the kids outside in the snow this winter. I love the high waist which measures approximately 3 inches. Also, I love the fact that these come with 2 in a pack and the colors look phenomenal. Unlike some other legging brands I've bought in the past, these leggings are not see through and revealing. Although I would not feel comfortable enough going shopping with these on, I feel like they are perfect for a relaxing day at home, and I would easily wear these outside to walk the dog, or to grab the mail, etc. I love how soft and warm these leggings are and they seem to wash well and are holding up nicely so far. Overall, I would recommend these to anyone that stays cold, like myself. I think these would be perfect to wear under clothing to help keep you warm on the colder days. I would recommend these to others, but keep in mind, they can be tricky to get on and are a little to tight for this mom of 4 to feel comfortable wearing out in public."", 'These leggings are really great quality. I love the thickness of them. Theres 2 leggings in the pack, mine had one grey one black. They are 95% polyester and 5% spandex. After washing and drying them they showed no signs of wear and still looked like new. The only problem i have is the size run small. It says the size is 2x/3x but its not. Its probably a large. Other than that, these are very well made high quality leggings and i would definitely recommend them in the right size. The thickness and quality is really amazing.', ""I received these Women's Plus Size High Waisted 2-Pack Fleece Lined Athleisure Leggings."", ""I have to start by saying how extremely soft and comfy these are. I also love the high waisted thick band at the top. I wear these with the waist band folded down like yoga pants. The fleece lining is so soft and comfy against my skin and so soooo warm. These will be a favorite this Winter for me. The length is great but the sizing runs very small compared to most other brands. I usually wear a size med/large or a sz 12 in pants/leggings....these fit perfectly and these are sized at a 2x/3x. There's a huge difference in sizing. I don't mind but anyone who is looking for a size true to a 2x/3x, would be very disappointed because these run so small."", 'Overall, I would recommend these but would really suggest double checking on size.', ""I recently received the “Women's Plus Size High Waisted 2-Pack Fleece Lined Athleisure Leggings” in the 2X/3X size. I picked these leggings specifically for my mom because she has recently decided to start walking in the mornings with me. As soon as I took these leggings out of the packaging I thought there was no way these leggings would fit my mom. I usually wear a size small/medium in leggings so I tried this 2X/3X sized legging on and it fit me perfectly. I didn't want to embarrass my mom by having her try these on and them not fitting so I asked my husband who wears a 38 x 29 size pants and they fit him pretty tight. I do have to admit that he was able to get them on and off but it wasn't really that comfortable. I do give these leggings extra points for being able to fit different sized bodies but that is a wide range of sizes to cover. I'm kind of interested to see how the size small/medium would fit me now. I did like the really high 3 inch waist because it really holds in that mama pouch that a lot of us women have. The fleece lining on the inside was super soft and really warm and just all-around felt great in the chilly weather. I also love the fact that these leggings come in a two pack."", 'These leggings are great! They are soft and fit true to size. They have a large band of material that is high waisted to help with tummy bulge. What I really like about them is that they are long enough to reach the top of my tennis shoes.', ""They are very warm.. And they fit great. The 2xl are very snug. But I will wear them. I was surprised to see that there was no seams in back or front and on sides. I would have rather had scenes in the front and back that's why I give it a four.

Also love that they are actually high waist, even with my belly in the way."", ""Run on the small size. In fact, I didn't think they would fit. They did, but I had to work at getting them on.

This gown comes to just above my knees, and although it seemed scratchy/itchy when I first tried on, it was fine after washing so maybe it was the sizing or something. The gown is 55% cotton and 45% polyester and it seemed cool enough for me and I tend to always be too warm. I took off the little bow decoration on front and the label and I found it to be very comfortable after that. I machine washed and dried it and it didn't seem wrinkled at all (although personally I don't see a problem with something you're sleeping in being wrinkled.) The fabric is a nice light weight. It is not sheer, but not totally opaque either. The keyhole neckline and smocking on the yoke are nice little feminine touches.

I washed it in cold water according to the label and dried it on low, however being only 55% cotton I should have realized it was going to shrink a little. Now it only shrunk a tad but it's noticeable. I strongly suggest you wash it on cold and line dry it because with the other 45% being polyester it shouldn't need ironing and by not putting it in the dryer it won't shrink.

I thought it was the No Boundaries brand. Not sure now. All I know is that these new ones are BAD compared to ALL of my prior purchases!! Really, really CHEAP looking and feeling. Also, less stretch than normal. I guess that can be OK for variety. Mainly, I was expecting to get the nice feeling shirts like before that are typically NOT see through and that feel good on your skin. Also, these are SHORTER in the body than normal... so again, that cheapens it. The sleeves are nice and long. The stitching is good. But everything else is so bad my jaw dropped when I pulled them out of the box. I suggest you go to the store in person to make sure you are getting the old quality and not these ratty, cheap ones."", 'Fits great very comfortably', 'Love them.

I went on-line and tried a couple of different Lee jeans and finally found the ones that fit the best and were most comfortable.

I have 18W Tall jeans I purchased last year, and they have a wide black-on-the-inside waistband with sayings like You are Strong. You are Talented. I don't really need the platitudes, but I DO need that 'comfort waistband.' Please bring it back. One more thing - the dark jeans are SUPER dark. Be aware of that when you order."", ""I haven't bought a pair of Lee Jeans for ages, as I live in Arizona and it's usually too hot for jeans. But these are a good lightweight jeans for winter here. The fit is great and I like the soft stretch fabric. Definitely getting another pair soon!"", 'I was and am so disappointed with these jeans. I\'ve been buying these jeans for about 6 years now and have several pair of the ""OLD"" Relaxed Fit. This time I got the ""New"" Relaxed fit thinking by ""New"" they meant better!! I could never be more wrong!! These are not even the same color. They are very thin and the dye job is awful, making them appear as though they have stripes across the area between the waist and hip area. I took a pic of both side by side. The pair on the left are about 3 years old and have been through the washer close to 100 times, the pair on the right have been washed once and were purchase back in August. They are supposed to be the same color but are far from being anything close. I would have sent them back but needed a pair of jeans for a certain occasion and didn\'t have enough time to wait. (Since my shirt was going to cover the stripes, I didn\'t let them bother me.) One of my main reasons for buying the old ""Relaxed Fit"" was because I have severe psoriasis covering both legs and Lee ""Old"" Relaxed Fit in Tall are the only pants that don\'t irritate my skin. I can hardly wait for the Old Relaxed Jeans to come back in 2017...I\'ll be checking in often and will definitely stock up this time!!!', 'This is the second pair I have bought for work and I love them ...they give me the comfort I need to bend stretch etc at work.', ""I liked the fit through the hip and legs, but the pants run big in the waist. I had to make the waist smaller by running elastic through the waist band. Wish jean makers wouldn't always make the waist so big. Women are not made straight up and down."", 'I always order tall length.  The length is a little bit shorter on these than my other Lee jeans.  They will do, but just wish they were about an inch longer. Otherwise, I like them.', ""I was afraid to order jeans online, but since Covid, I don't go in the stores and try on cloths. I ordered my usual size. I'm 5'-9” so i selected the long version (better longer than too short). I was happy i did! They fit very well. They are comfortable jeans and very good quality. I've already purchased another pair!"", 'Love these jeans! Fabric is a light weight denim  with a wonderful amount of stretch built in. I am 5ft 4 in and this is the perfect length. I loved the jeans so much that I ordered another!', ""Love these jeans! Full enough to fit my full hips, yet not have the usual 4” gap in the waist! Perfect fit, and great comfortable feel! Finally, a pair of jeans I don't have to alter before I can wear them! : )"", ""I've been buying Lee Jeans for over 10 years. From the first time I tried on Lee Jeans and purchased them to now, I have always been happy with the fit and cut. Also, the length is perfect.... and they never shrink and shorten up over time. I currently wear a plus size, but if I ever get back to women's sizes, I will still wear Lees. Regardless of what size I may be, I know that these jeans will always fit my waist and curvy hips just right."", 'I love how these fit my curves without too much fabric, I have had plus size jeans that worked but seemed to always have a bunch of extra fabric in the areas of the curves such as the stomach area. Lee found nice material that is not too thick or too thin with just enough stretch to fit my curves and flatter my shape. The material colors are classy and trendy. I found the recommended sizes to be too big, so I must not know how to measure myself but with free shipping both ways it was convenient to send back the wrong size. The price alerts are great as I will buy more in a smaller size for summer when the price drops again, I need bigger size for winter so I can wear long johns underneath. I like the straigh leg as I am tired of the skinny jean-sometimes too restricting, as well as the boot cut-sometimes too baggy and drafty on my legs in the winter.', 'I have been a Lee customer for many years. I work in a business casual environment, so black jeans are allowed. I where them every day (with different tops of course), but at one point, Lee stopped making the black jeans that I have been buying for years and years. I was so disappointed. But finally, they have returned and I have stocked up on them. What do I love the most about these jeans? Two things; one is that they come in a longer length (not talls, but longer 33"") and the second thing is, the belt loops. Yup! I said belt loops. They are place strategically and generously around the waist so your belt stays in place. I still have 9 more years to work, and I\'m begging Lee to NEVER get rid of these jeans again. I simply LOVE them!', 'I love these jeans because they come in long plus they have a little stretch in them and will not bust at the seams. They look good & come in a few colors.

I got a bigger size so I would not flash any skin as I hustled and moved, but the shirt is long enough and has ample stretch to avoid that issue. It is wash and wear, does not wrinkle, and should take an embroidered logo well for people who are shopping for company uniform shirts. This really does compare to shirts I had to purchase for a professional firm that required business uniforms on certain days, and I ordered those shirts from a famous and somewhat expensive catalog company. One thing this shirt has that those do not, is an invisible hooter hider snap in the button placket, right where a large bust would stretch open the placket. Love that. The fabric is NOT at all cotton-y, and it feels a little like windbreaker material, so it would probably not be good for business formal attire, but business dress and business casual would be just fine.

Originally I found one style I really liked.  Years passed and I went to buy more but the number search returned a similar but different bra, with the same part number.   Years passed again and I went to buy more and the number showed no search returns.  This bra was one that I decided to try, along with one other.  Both now have 4 hooks for my size where as my sized use to have 3.  I feel like I'm wearing a  corest with all this extra fabric and hooks.  With this bra, the cup had too much material and so there were wrinkles in it that showed through my top.  The other bra, obviously the same size, did not do that.  My size hasn't changed since I was 13.  The cup also shaped my breasts in an odd manner, kind of like bullets and the points pointed outwards, to the side.  The result wasn't at all like the photo.

Decided to order another one and believe you me, this one ran small for me! It would have taken two sizes up before I could have comfortably worn it.

I'm built hippy (not heavy, just curvy) so they didn't quite work for my shape.

I wore them when lounging around the house, to go shopping and even to go to the gym.   In 2015 I lost a lot of weight and went back to the store to purchase more but to no avail.  I was able to find them online and again, bought all 3 colors, this time in a size small.  Same great capris.  Well, recently i did  gain some weight and again went on line to buy more.  This time i bought mediums.   Sizing is very consistent to other clothing.  There is shrinkage but it is minimal.  Would i recommend these, absolutely yes.\nI am 5'7 and the hems go to just  below my knee caps.  They are straight legged vs pegging at the knees.  Very flattering.  If i had to change anything about the capris, I would add slash pockets.  I do miss not having pockets."", ""Great fit, nicely made with perfect medium thickness.  Love the stripe.

I don\'t put them in the dryer so they shrunk ever so slightly after the first wash. I am 5\' 9"" tall and weigh 180 pounds. I purchased the XL because most of my height is in my legs and I have athletic thighs. These pants are my new favorite. They are not too snug in the thighs and do not ride up my thighs when I walk. I have worn them to run only once so far since it\'s still warm enough outside to run in shorts. But I wear them almost exclusively around the house, working from home, walking the dogs, etc. I have slept in them a couple of times.

This sports bra is to die for I've used others with snap on fronts, zipper fronts and none are 1/2 as comfortable as this bra.  I love this sports bra in fact I think I'm going to wear it at home as an everyday bra it's so comfortable.

It is easy to put on especially for one who has mobility problems reaching around to fasten a traditional bra.   My only problem is by only ordering by the size around and not by cup size it kind of tends to make you look like you have a uniboob unless you put the extra liner in the cup so you actually have some form.   I don't generally wear a padded bra as I don't need one but  this helps to give the cups more shape.   They only included one set of liners so you have to remove and replace with each bra.

It was 41 degrees out; I wore the black one under a thin blouse and I only added a running jacket. I was perfectly warm. After being washed, there is no pilling. A super bonus about these tops is they are made from recycled water bottles. I got a small (size 4-6) and it fit perfectly.', ""Absolutely in LOVE with these thermals. They come in white and black and have an adorable V neck on them. Which is way cuter than the typical thermal. Theyre extremely soft and comfy and definitely keep you warm in the winter. No air is getting through these thermals! And i love that they're cute to wear by themselves! I'll definitely be getting me some more! I got a size small and they fit perfectly and are true to size"", 'No annoying tags', 'Very form fitting from hips to waist with no riding up or slipping.', 'Will fit over a larger bust and also feel snug at the natural waist.', 'White fabric seems somewhat thin and a tad sheer but very comfortable without being overly warm.', 'Bottom hem is loosely stitched.', 'Very smooth and will not grab at the fabric of overlaying shirts. Slides inside long sleeves with ease.', 'i would recommend both the V-neck and Crew version. Prefer the black over white as I could wear the black on its own.', 'Seams are comfortable, there is a little bunching under the arms.', ""This is a well rounded shirt that can be used for many uses, i.e. sleeping and lounging. I only need this for sleeping when it is really cold outside, mid winter use. But for relaxing days it is nice to wear and you can still get things done, the sleeves can be pushed up and they will stay there so they don't get in the way when you need to do something. That makes it a versatile t-shirt that can be used for more than a night shirt. It is only for a top pajama use it is not long enough to be a one piece wear, but the colors available are complimentary to anything."", 'It is a good brand name and their products are long lasting and still hold their shape for many years. You can purchase their products without trying them on in the package and know you will have a good quality article of clothing that will last till you outgrow it. I still have items from them that are still wearable after at least a decade and I just add new items to round out those articles and they still get constant use. It is polyester and cotton, no fabric softener needed.', 'These thermal tops are lightweight yet they keep you warm, I walk in the early morning when it is still quite chilled, and these thermal tops along with a jacket keep me warm. They are a poly/cotton blend so they wash up well, I do not put in the the dryer. The round neckline is comfortable not too tightening around the neck area, the v-neck not to low. The v-neck runs a bit larger in the chest, which I prefer. The black small measures 34"" in the chest seam to seam, the white v-nec measures 36"". The size small fits a 4-6. SawOverall I definitely would recommend these fruit of the loom thermals. Thanks walmart spark review program.', 'These thermals make a great accessory. A must have in your closet for diversity and texture. They offer rich colors and are true to the color shown. So, so soft and waffle breathable material. They use 80% recycled polyester and 20% cotton. Every stitch neatly in place. They are made well. The cuffs are ribbed and do keep the cold out. The reason for 4 stars is for the size. They run small in size. I got the next size up and perfect ....for me. The material is kind of thin and also a little sheer depending on your taste. I can accessorize and make what I have look like more wearing these thermals. I can wear them under a nice blazer or vest! The colors and texture pop! Or wear alone with a nice scarf and a pair of jeans, casual look. It makes it easy to adjust to any body temperature. Dress them up or down. Easy care wash, cold. Tumble dry on low.', 'These two shirts are very comfortable. It was very nice to get two of them. My daughter really liked them, especially the red one. The sleeves were nice and long so they would even cover your hands if it was very cold out. The shirts are well made. There were no strings hanging and the seams are durable.', 'I like these shirts and they can be worn in a variety of ways. They can be worn as a base layer in cold climates. Also, the shirts have a v-neck which makes them look good to wear alone. They do not look like longjohns! Another option is to wear as pajama tops. They are soft and comfortable so you will feel cosy all night. Fruit os the Loom is a respectable company and I feel confident in their products.', 'Upon first appearance these thermals look thin and light weight, they were thin enough to see light pass through them After wearing them found them to be much warmer then they appear. The colors are very nice and work with my wardrobe very well. For the most part I was impressed with them. The texture was that which you would expect of thermals but they are soft and comfortable. I am a bit concerned with the quality, one of the shirts had a small hole in it when we got it. The hole has not gotten bigger nor have any more holes appeared at this time. All in all a very good product that I would buy again. Additional colors and if the material would be great, and a slightly heavier material might be nice for extreme weather conditions', '.', ""I received this product as a member of the walmart spark reviewer program. It is getting very cold (and will likely get colder) so i got these forms wife who really likes them as they are very comfortable. The only caveat is that these thermals are a bit baggy on the arm length so it gets annoying when its worn as an undergarment. The material is soft but the strechyness doesn't seem like it will stand the test of time from slacking especially around the v-neck. Time will tell. The main reason i recommend this thermal is the it keeps you very warm and they come in very nice colors."", ""The fruit of the loom thermal tops Fit for Me arrived by UPS. They was delivered in a nice thick smaller brown cardboard shipping box. There were two thermal tops that were placed in a clear plastic wrapping that was taped closed for transport. When placing an order on line the there are different choices of colors and sizes. I chose the maroon and gray colored tops. The maroon colored top came with a V neckline. The gray colored top has a crew neckline. The are no tags sewn in with these fruit of the loom thermal tops that can poke or annoy the back of the neck. All of the information about the thermal tops are manufactured stamped inside during production, which is located on the back of the neckline. The thermal tops are made of 70% polyester and 24% cotton so shrinkage is minimal. The end results is a very soft cotton like feel waffle texture material that is breathable. The fabric is not scratchy it flows on the body and doesn't get stretched out. The fabric is produced and sewn together tightly so it will not snag and fall apart. When washing use the gentle cycle do not add fabric softener in the washing machine and the low heat in the dryer this helps to keep there shape. They are loose fitting not tight, lightweight and long enough to cover the mid section to the thighs. There is no flap in the back. Both of the thermals are double stitched on the collar and has some stretch for comfort and it doesn't bind around the neck. There are no buttons or snaps to make wearing the tops uncomfortable. These thermal tops trap more body heat and makes it ideal to wear during the cold winter months. Fruit of the loom offers all different types of thermals for the entire family. Fruit of the loom thermals are made in El Salvador."", ""I thought 4XL would plenty big enough but it's pretty tight and if it shrinks during a wash, I probably won't be able to wear them. I like the fact they're made from old plastic bottles and I would buy more items recycled like this. The tops are soft and if not for the tight fit , they would be perfect. Most items I get or 3XL or 4XL so you might want to order a size up on these."", ""ok so I got my Fit For Me by Fruit of the Loom Women's Plus Waffle Thermal Lounge Crew & V-Neck Top - 2 Pack yesterday.

They just need to b longer a little thicker for me"", ""The fit by me thermal shirts are soft to the touch and the selected size fit perfectly. It is lightweight and breathable. I was comfortable wearing it. The neck line on both the round neck and v-neck was not tight and fit well around the wrist and did not cover the hand, It stayed in place . The length is long enough so I didn't have to keep pulling it down. The thermal shirt was smooth under my clothing so it didn't even look as if I had it on. The stitching on the buttom is thin and when I had them worn inside my pants it was not bulky. I washed them and they didn't stretch out of place. It stayed like new . I even wore it as a longing shirt and had no problems. The spandex feel of the shirt stretched and moved along with me. I liked the selection of colors available. I think it's a great soft to the touch, warm, lightweight thermal and would recommend to family and friends. I give it 5 stars out of 5 stars."", 'I was really surprised when I washed this shirt that it did not shrink. I have never had a thermal shirt that did not shrink. This is really cool! And it is very soft. It feels really good against your skin.', 'The material is a little thinner than I thought that it would be. I think that could be because it is made of 74 % Polyester and 26% Cotton. That is probably why it did not shrink too. I was still warm in it. I wore it under another shirt and was warm all day. I did not get over heated when I was doing things while wearing it either. It kept me just right in temperature.', 'I did not give it five stars because I did have a problem with the shirt riding up. I tried tucking it in my pants to see if that would help it stay in place. But it did still ride up some. I did not like the feeling of it getting higher on my neck.', 'The body of the shirt could be a little longer. I felt like it was not as long as some shirts of this type. But the sleeves are a really good length. I really likes this. I was able to stretch my arm out in front of me and the cuff of the shirt stayed at my wrist.', 'I like that the package has two shirts in it. And that the package has two different types of shirts.

She is very happy with these and you know the adage: Happy wife, happy life!"", 'I have been buying fruit of the Loom clothing for years.

My favorite feature on these shorts is the adjustable waist! You used to only see the button adjustable waist on the higher end children stores, but not anymore! You simply adjust the button inside the waist band and you are able to accommodate several sizes! My child is on the thinner side, so this is perfect for helping the pants fit.

First off they weren't kidding when they say these are slim boys. My son is 9 and he is only 2 lbs above being considered underweight so he is pretty slim and these shorts didn't fit him! He had to suck in as much as he could just to button them and I got the size 10 so they should have definitely fit him. So I would say they run very small. I guess I should have gotten a size 12. It was disappointing too because I was hoping to use these along with a cute shirt I got him for his school picture day tomorrow but I had to search for a different option for shorts. If they did fit him I would probably recommend but being as he was really not able to use them there isn't much to go by in terms of how good they are or how comfortable. They seem to be a good material thought and not thin. They do adjust but that does not do anything helpful if they are already to small, that only is beneficial if they start out being to big. The size issue has nothing to do with the quality though as like I said that seems to be up to par and for that reason I would recommend as not everyone will have the same issue we did.

My kid loves that they are thick, but not stiff. The color is perfect for camouflaging light stains and dirt. The hidden elastic belt allows it to be shrunk to her waist. Because her waist is so small, it creates ruffles and makes it look puffy, which she likes. My favorite part about the elastic belt is that the ends are sewn into the pant so there’s no risk of losing them when pulling too hard. It is also a bit on the long side, but she just tucks in the seam and she’s good to go. I know this pair of pants is for boys, which would explain why they’re too wide and too long. My girls have been raised with boy clothes because they are more durable than the equivalent in girls. Considering that my girls act like boys and like climbing trees, sliding on the grass, jumping fences, etc, boys’ pants last them much longer than girls’ pants.

It is made of 98% Cotton and 2% Spandex. Not only the pants is soft, but there is a dual layer material around the knee area. The material used inside of the knee is even softer than the rest of the pants.

The fit is not too baggy as it comes in a straight cut. The knees are reinforced with a think fabric in the inside, making them harder to rip. My son always seems to “eat” through pants as they rip from the knees very fast, but with reinforced knees the pants last longer. The fabric has a little stretch in it since it is 98% cotton and 2% spandex. The material is strong and thick, but they are not a hot material. I feel like the stretch will also help them last longer and not get ripped easily as well as allowing my son to move more comfortably through his day at school.

But, when you purchase, be sure to order a size larger than normal.', 'Overall, I was pretty happy with these Wonder Nation boys’ school uniform pants! I was very surprised at how great the quality of the pants seems to be, and how soft they were. They also feel very durable but the softness of the material doesn’t make them feel stiff. They have a really nice stretch to them, and I think they’re going to really hold up over time. I love that there’s a stain release treatment, so hopefully that will keep them stain free throughout the many wears. The reinforced knee patch is a great feature – especially for boys – and doesn’t seem to bother my son at all like other similar products do. I love that they are wrinkle resistant so I don’t need to iron them. The adjustable elastic waistband is an absolute must for my children so this is a vital feature for me. The color is a nice dark navy, which I’m hoping doesn’t fade over time. The only complaint that I have is that when I washed them, the pants attracted fuzz from the other clothes – which is not something that happens with the other uniform pants we own. Overall, I would highly recommend these uniform pants to anyone that needs good quality, affordable school clothes.', 'I like these pants, the material and cut are comfortable for the kiddos.

The material appears to be good quality. Unfortunately my little one will have to grow some more before he can wear these. The button closure is a metal clasp on the inside. It is easy to open and close. They have side pockets and back pockets. Overall the pants are nice but I definitely recommend you consider sizing down.', ""These pants are made in Dominican Republic. The washing instructions are to machine wash with like colors and tumble dry low. You may use an iron on the lowest setting if needed, but I find if I take out of the dryer right away, I don't need to iron. There is no instructions for the washing temperature.

He has a little room to grow in them, but they do not drag on the floor."", '', ""There are a few things about these pants that I think make for an amazing pair of pants. The first is I love that these pants have reinforced knees. My son is very active (as I assume all boys are) and the knees are the first to go in pants. So, pants with added knee supports is always a bonus! The second is my son is skinny. Like super skinny so getting pants that fit him in length usually are so big in the waist they fall off of him. These have the adjustable waist, So I don't have to worry about them falling down. The third is these are made with 98% cotton and 2% spandex.

A quick “wack” out of the dryer and then folded makes these pants look neat and straight. Of course, iron them if you’re looking for a sharp-edged crease, but word of caution on that: “iron on lowest setting, if needed” reads the instructions on the inside of the pants. They are made of mostly cotton and with only 2% spandex. The tag on the pants says they are stain release and wrinkle resistant. These pants would make a nice addition to any child’s school wardrobe, uniform or not.', 'The Wonder Nation Boys School Uniform Pants look very sturdy. They are navy blue and are size five with 25 inches in length. The waist is adjustable which is good when you need a bigger or smaller waist. There are four pockets in total two in the front and two in back. There is a snap slip button and zipper. There is a reinforced knee and belt loops round out the pants.', 'I received the Wonder Nation brand boy’s school uniform in straight fit, navy blue, in a size 4. It is solidly constructed and looks stylish, while still being comfortable and durable. Some details that I love about this pant is that there are four large pockets, two in back and two on the side. There is also an invisible elastic in the waist with adjustable button holes so that you can take in the waist band a bit if you child is smaller, and the item can grow with your child as needed. The front button on the pant is decorative and instead there is a metal clasp to hold the pant in place along with the zipper. For older kids this is not a big deal, but for younger children especially those that are just learning to potty train this is perfect because a simple clasp is so much easier for them to do themselves and really gives a sense of independence to the child. I also like how the item is tagless. Wash instructions are printed right onto the inside of the pant so there are no itchy tags to bother your child. I love thoughtful design and I greatly appreciate these small details in clothing. The pants are 98% cotton and 2% spandex, and can be machine washed and dried on low.', 'When the Wonder Nation Boys School Uniform Super Soft Flat Front Pants arrived I was happy to see they are made with almost all cotton and a bit of spandex for flexible comfort while playing. I was impressed by how well they are made and the softness of the fabric. They have strong belt loops, slit pockets on front and back, and the waist adjustment tab on the inside. The waist adjuster is unlike others I have had in kids pants before. It is actually sewn on both sides so you can tighten the waist to the desired button but it you prefer no button adjustment the elastic stays in place. Instead of getting pulled into the slit never to be found again. I picked a size eight since generally my son is wearing an 8 but slightly into 10. They were a bit too small for him in the waist and length. I definity should have went with the size ten. My son really liked the feel and comfort of the pants though and I’m guessing the ten will work perfect. I paired the pants with the Wonder Nation dress shirt as can be seen in the photos. I received a nice full catalog in the package that shows all the colors and sizes of all their school clothes. I was impressed how inexpensive the shirt and pants are! They feel and look like much more costly school uniforms.', 'They are soft and they don’t seem to wrinkle as bad with the material. I would recommend!

My daughter has already abused this skirt and it still looks amazing after several washes. It is a navy blue and looks great with a variety of tops.

The durable polyester twill fabric made this skirt.\xa0Now my daughter wants to use the same gray skirt or skort for anime costume birthday party. As spark reviewer, I suggest this Skirt by Wonder Nation. The school year will start in a month, so start shopping your kid(s) uniform at Walmart and look for Wonder Nation brand ^_^.', ""Okay, so I have a leggy six year old girl. It just so happens that this year they do not have a set uniform to wear. But, for me, it is so much easier to have a few basic mix and match bottoms and several more basic mix and match tops. So this size 6 navy blue bow skirt with shorts underneath fits really well into her school wardrobe. The length works, so it is not too short to wear to school, while still being a cute length for a child. The shorts underneath are an absolute must for an active six year old. I don't even buy skirts without shorts underneath unless she's going to wear tights with them. And actually, she can wear tights with this skirt in the winter time. The skirt and shorts are 100% polyester. So it's not breathable, but keeps wrinkles away really well. The waistband is about an inch and the front is very sturdy and flat, with a center bow. The back of the waistband is gathered and stretchy. The three pleats in the front are really schoolgirl cute and allows for more movement during exercise time and outside play. There are no pleats or pockets in the back, which is fine. My little one is tall and skinny (48lbs, about 4'2”) and the waist is a tiny bit big on her, but I give it a few more months and it will be fitting fine. The one thing that would put this skirt over the top is if it had front pockets."", ""This is a good quality skirt for school. Cute little belt design on the front with pleats. I bought this fir my 9nyr old who's on the smaller size (4 ft 4, 56lbs, size 10/12) and it was too big for her as there isn't any way to tighten the skirt. This did fit my 12 (4 ft 11.5, 62lbs) year old who usually wears 14/16 as she's long legged. He came down to her knees and didn't need to be tightened"", 'I have a 6.5 year old daughter that would wear skirts and dresses everyday if I let her. Unfortunately, with her growing up with brothers, she doesn\'t usually sit ""properly"" which is a concern of mine once she started school. I generally would make her wear pants/shorts to school, despite her begging to wear skirts/dresses. One the days I do give in to let her wear a dress/skirt, I would always make her wear a pair of cotton shorts underneath. I could not wait for her to give these a try because they have the shorts already built into the skirt. I chose to get the skirt in a size 7 because she generally wears clothing between a size 6 to a size 8 (depending on the brand, etc.). This particular brand seems to run a little on the bigger side, but I\'m sure within in the next month she will fit it perfectly, just in time for school to start. It is mostly only big in the waist portion, but I feel like once it gets washed a time or two, it will provide a better fit for her. I love the dark, black color this skirt has and the bow is a huge winning point for my daughter. Another thing to take note of is the length of this skirt. I was expecting a skirt that would be about mid-thigh area whereas this one comes completely down to her knees. The material this skirt is made out of seems like it is not only comfortable for her to wear, but that it is also durable enough to last for many years to come. Overall, I am completely satisfied with this skirt. The color looks amazing, the bow makes it unique and I feel like it will last her for a few years until she outgrows it. I would recommend this skirt to anyone with a child headed back to school. I feel like it can be worn for any school setting and would go perfectly with any shirt.', 'This skirt is made in Vietnam. The skirt and shorts are made from 100% polyester. The skirt is fairy thick and not see thru at all. The front has pleats and the back is smooth. The waist is very stretchy elastic. The front design is so adorable with the metal rings and a ribbon bow. The bow is sewn on and cannot be adjusted.', ""The skirt underneath is thin. I would suggest having the child wear neutral under garments so that you cannot see a print, but otherwise is great. Your child can do cartwheels and all the running they want without showing anything they shouldn't."", 'The skirt seems pretty true to size. My child just had a growth spurt and her waist is a tad thinner right now. So the skirt fits, but is a little big in the waist. This will probably fit her perfect in the fall.', 'This skirt has the approval from my child. I would love if it were in cotton rather than polyester, but beautiful skirt.', ""This is a cute scooter. It's durable, easy care, comfortable. The material has a nice soft feel to it. The elastic waistband is great for my granddaughter. I also love the built-in shorts since my granddaughter is very active at school. The size was a true fit, even after washing and drying it fit great and comfy. The scooter can also be worn outside of school with a cute shirt. The only complaint I have, is I wish it was about an inch longer but other than that this is an awesome scooter that's prices right."", 'My 6.5 year old daughter absolutely LOVES wearing skirts/dresses to school. Unfortunately, she doesn\'t sit ""properly"" while wearing them unless I\'m there to constantly remind her. For this reason, I generally make her wear a pair of shorts under her skirts and dresses. With school starting back in about a month, I know she is going to want to wear skirts to school. This cute skirt comes with the shorts already built in, so therefore I feel more inclined to let her wear these to school. I think this skirt would be perfect for any school-type setting. I chose to get the skirt in a size 7 since my daughter wears clothes in a size 6 up to a size 8 (depending on the brand). I will say, this skirt runs a bit on the larger side. The waist is currently a bit lose on her, but I\'m sure she will quickly grow into it, possibly before school even starts. The cute bow really brings this skirt together and I feel like it will last her through the school year with no issues. I also like how well this color can be matched with about any shirt. Overall, I am satisfied with this skirt and I feel like it would be a great addition to any wardrobe for school age children.', ""This skirt was a long awaited surprise for my daughter! She loves skirts, but I have been hesitant to let her wear one to school, as she isn't good with sitting properly. But this skirt, unlike many others I have bought, has sewn in biking shorts!! It also has a really cute bow on the top, which was absolutely adorable and I knew my daughter would love it. However, when she tried this skirt on, it was WAY too big! She is a size 5 in other children's clothes, but this size 5 was a lot larger than normal. She was very disappointed, but I promised to hold on to them so she can wear it when she gets bigger. The beige color would into what is acceptable for most school uniforms and the length is appropriate. If you are ordering this skirt online, check for a sizing chart to make sure you are ordering the appropriate size. If you are planning to purchase in-store, get the child to try on the item before buying. It is a beautiful skirt, but the size is definitely an issue if you are hoping to use this product sooner rather than later."", 'I received the Wonder Nation Girls Plus School Uniform Bow Scooter and am very happy with it. It fit a little big but it gives her room to grow for the school year. So as long as the skort can make it through the wash she should be able to wear it all school year. I do reccomend taking it out of the dryer immediately so you will not have to iron it. It dries quite nicely but if left in the pile of clothes too long it will need to be ironed as it will be full of wrinkles.', 'this is a great scooter skirt, very stylish and my child really enjoyed it. we do not have to use uniforms but she already has planned a outfit for back to school with this skirt. i like the built in shorts to keep my childs modesty while still being able to be a kid. overall great qualit great skirt. my daughter wears a size 12 and this skirt is a size 12 and it was slighly big.', ""This skirt was a long awaited surprise for my daughter!

Especially if she going to school or anywhere outside the house. When she tried it, it was just perfect not to short or too long. Even though it was just the right size I always want my daughters to make sure they wear a shorts under their skirts. That's another thing I like about this skirt , it comes with small shorts under the skirt Stitch to it. She needs no shorts under , all she does it put on the Girls Plus School Uniform Button Side Tab Scooter and she's ready to go. The waist is adjustable , makes it fit just right. The material is made of is very thick and strong material. The stitches are very good and tight. This Girls Plus School Uniform Button Side Tab Scooter won't be ripping easily. When I wash the Girls Plus School Uniform Button Side Tab Scooter I try not to wash it in hot water I feel like it will fade after so many times. I rather wash it cold or warm water. I dont know if it shrinks or not so I just hang it up to dry on its own.
